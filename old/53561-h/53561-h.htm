author has no doubt but that many captious
readers, upon opening this book, will find it
puzzling. They will think that it does not present
the subject in an orderly fashion. They would much
prefer to have us suggest one month’s study of outlines,
and then finish with the subject; then two
months’ study of shading, which we would maintain
covered the whole ground; and they would wish us
to separate with equal positiveness the whole study
of drawing into distinct portions. To these criticisms
I reply with the following parable:</p>

<p>Mrs. Smith, the mother of a large family, distressed
by the bigness of the physician’s bill (or rather by
her husband’s complaints of the same), procured at
the druggist’s a case of homœopathic medicine, with
a booklet directing its dispensation, which would
enable her to act as her family physician, and bringing
it home perused it with delight, as she found
every ailment which her children were heir to extensively
described therein—chicken-pox, croup, diphtheria
and scarlet fever were alphabetically set down,
and their proper remedy clearly named. When she
retired she staid awake, almost hoping to hear little
Johnny cough or Mary toss in her crib, that she
might prove her knowledge of symptomatology, and
the efficacy of the drugs.</p>

<p>Alas, a month’s experience brought with it a
source of embarrassment which she had not anticipated
on procuring her book. True, she had learned
it by heart with ease, and knew that for a slight
attack of fever one drop of aconite and two of belladonna
should be given on alternate days, and that
for an incipient attack of croup she should give
one drop of aconite every half hour, “which might be
administered more frequently if the case showed symptoms
of rapid development.” Alas, the difficulty did
not arise from any omission in the book directions
for applying remedies, but the puzzling point was
to distinguish in nature between the symptoms of
croup, for instance, and those of an ordinary cold.
Was Johnny’s sonorous barking due to a real croupy
throat, or was it the natural formation of his vocal
organs which gave so ominous a tone to a cough
that might be only the result of his wading in the
rain barrel the morning before? Was Tommy’s calling
for “a wink of water” no less than six times in
a night due to a prospective fever, or was it the
result of loneliness because he had for the first time
<span id="p005">been</span>
put in the spare room, and wanted his mother’s
company? Was little Mary’s restlessness indicative of
a coming attack of measles, or the result of her
cousin’s having read her, that afternoon, “The Goblins
’ll Get You if You Don’t Watch Out.” These
were the puzzling questions; if the physician could
only diagnose the case for her, she herself could have
administered the proper quota of drops of aconite or
belladonna.</p>

<p>The moral is plain. Those books on drawing
which say, “Having made correct outlines, begin to
shade with an F pencil as follows,” are very easy
reading; but an attempt at application soon convinces
one that such instruction presupposes an
amount of previous eye-training on the part of
the student which is not often the endowment of the
ordinary man.</p>

has been in recent years a marked change
in the character of the printing done in this country;
plain printing has been superseded by decorative
printing; the typographer of a few years back was only
a compositor and pressman, today he should be a
designer as well. In view of that requirement this little
treatise is written, in the hope that, though its advice
may not make an illustrator out of its reader, it will at
least acquaint him with some principles of design that
he may apply in his daily practice.</p>

<p>The reader will not be deceived, the writer not misunderstood,
if at the outset it is put on record that great
success in art is dependent much more upon natural
ability, aye, genius, than upon study, and that these
chapters can only tell you how to study—they cannot
guarantee you success. A man of fifty, a master printer,
may study our advice thoroughly and then attempt
to <span class="xxpn" id="p018">{18}</span>
draw an elephant chasing an African, and the result
may be conspicuously inferior to the treatment of the
same subject by little eight-year-old Johnny Green who
is yet in the primary school; but Johnny Green may
have “an eye for drawing” and our master printer be
as devoid of it as is a cow of melody in her voice.</p>

<p>Not only is it true that without talent you must not
expect to succeed in producing important pictures, such
as full-page illustrations, double-column portraits, poster
designs and large work in general, but it is almost more
unlikely that you will succeed in designing the most
simple tailpiece or initial letter. It is quite natural that
you should suppose it a very easy task to design an
initial letter or a tiny silhouette of a leaf or flower, a
branch or wreath or two forming a “printer’s mark”;
every artist in Christendom thinks the same—until he
tries it; but you would be surprised if I filled this chapter
with the history of certain initial letters and devices,
and tracing them to their fountain head, we found that
in nine cases out of ten they were designed by the very
greatest artists of the time.</p>

<p>You can take it as an undisputed fact that should
some publishing house wish an ordinary full-page illustration
for a book, and at the same time a simple “publisher’s
mark,” a device about an inch square for the
title-page of that book, they would find ten artists who
could execute the former to one who could design the
latter so that it would be up to the standard of the best
“marks” in history.</p>

<p>Is it then, you ask, our intention at the very start
to discourage you, and advise you to attempt nothing
because you cannot excel in anything? Not at all.
A <span class="xxpn" id="p019">{19}</span>
country editor need not refrain from studying rhetoric
so as to improve the style of his editorials, just because
he knows that without genius he may not expect to
equal the diction of Macaulay. The rhetoric may not
give him wit to put in his editorials, but it at least may
teach him to cast his sentences properly. So this treatise
may not supply you with “art feeling,” but it will,
we hope, show you how to make a design in a more
workmanlike way than you would without our advice;
and we most sincerely advise you to try.</p>

<p>Everyone in asking the question, “How should I
begin to learn to draw?” expects that the answer will
direct him to use certain materials in a certain way, and
that by the manipulation of these materials in this certain
way, he will get the desired result. So far as this
treatise is concerned, the reader will be disappointed in
this regard; it is true that the writer is particularly
interested in the technic of the different graphic arts,
and later on will have something to say about the best
methods for pen drawing, for chalk-plate, for wood
engraving; but in these first chapters on drawing it
must be distinctly understood that our advice is that the
student should not worry about what pencil or what
paper he should use, or about how his lines should look,
but should realize from the outset that his principal
study should be the education of his eye. The reason
that we do not draw well in infancy is because we have
not learned to see. You may take it as a positive fact
that the untrained eye of every man sees things in an
absolutely incorrect manner—or rather he does not
know how he sees things. Let us take, for example, an
immense factory-building with over a hundred windows
<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="spncpg1">
Looking at these buildings as in this picture, an artist knows that a
doorway or a window in the building with the dome would appear as a perfect
rectangle, as we see in the case of the main doorway, because seen “in
front view”; but the windows in the buildings at the sides are not perfect
rectangles because, being seen “in perspective,” or at an angle, their sills
and lintels seem to tip downward. The uneducated eye, however, knowing
them to be rectangles, sees them as such, not realizing that each receding
window is narrower than its predecessor; and that, moreover, the lintels and
sills of a window in a higher story have a greater tip than those of one below,
and that every lintel has greater tip than its corresponding sill. This
knowledge, however, should be known to all artists through the study of
perspective.</span>

is standing directly in front of the building; the chances
are that he sees every window in a tolerably correct
manner. He sees that all the windows are alike, etc.;
that each is a certain distance from the other, etc.
Good! But now let him walk to the end of the building
and look at it diagonally; he still sees the building as he
saw it in the front view; depend upon it, that he sees
each window as a perfect rectangle, and each window
the same distance from the other; he would be incapable
of going home and showing you on a piece of paper the
“direction” of every window line. Let an artist step
in his place and he sees every window <i>different</i> from the
other! You probably do not realize the full truth of
this statement at present, but you will after we have our
chapter on perspective. For the present please take
my word for it, and bear in mind that you must first
learn to see.</span></p>

<p>Let us take the caricature by Albert Engström for
our first lesson. We have selected it for two reasons:
first, because it is a caricature, and we wish our readers
to realize that this treatise is going to be of use to printers
from the beginning, and that we are going to study
drawing in an interesting manner. Many a printer is
as well the publisher of a newspaper and feels that from
time to time he would like to publish a caricature to
enliven his pages, or at any rate he is interested in the
cartoons in the illustrated press, and would like to know
how they are done, and the best way to acquire this
knowledge is to practice a little one’s self. Besides,
the practice of caricaturing is most beneficial to every
draftsman; there have been but few great painters
who <span class="xxpn" id="p023">{23}</span>
have not indulged in it. Another reason for using this
cut is that it is drawn in a very simple manner in a few
strong lines. While the students at the art schools
usually begin to get effects with light and shade, the
printer will do well to master outline sooner than light
and shade, for it is the most quickly executed and the
most easily engraved, and, I need not add, last but not
least, most easily printed. I should advise you then
to take commonplace objects that are about the house
and make innumerable sketches of them in the manner
of this drawing. Take a derby hat for example, place
it a little above the eye and endeavor to draw it as Engström
did his. Do not worry much about your style of
drawing, do not complain that your pen will not work
and that you cannot get a line varying in thickness like
this one; or if you do succeed, do not ask your friends
to admire your handsome pen line; do not think about
your drawing at all, but solely about learning to see.
Place the hat above you, notice that you see the under
part of the brim nearer you, and the inside of the brim
on the far side; if there is not a head under the hat
endeavor with a single curved line to indicate as much
of the lining as you see; if you see anything else that is
<i>not</i> given in Engström’s drawing and you try to express
it as he expresses things you employ an excellent
method of study. Next place the hat in the same position
but below the eye, on the seat of a chair, and
notice that you no longer see under the brims but inside
of them; then place the hat on its crown upon the chair
so that you see the oval of the inside of its crown, and
endeavor to express that oval with two semi-circles, as
simple as the one which Engström uses in drawing
the <span class="xxpn" id="p024">{24}</span>
crown of the hat. Again, put the hat on the mantelpiece
and draw a side view of it; this will be more
simple than any of the other views. I think that an
hour’s practice of this kind will soon convince you that
the casual glance of the uneducated eye does not take
in a complete or perfect view of an object, but that after
you have studied an object with a view to drawing it,
you begin to see with more thoroughness. You will,
I think, notice, as you walk home in the evening, the
contours of the different hats that you see in the hatter’s

window, and upon the pedestrians; you will begin to
guess how you would draw such a hat or cap, and from
time to time you will see headgear that “lends itself to
drawing,” as it were; you will say, “When I go home
I will try to draw that hat.” We print on this page
an interesting drawing by Gerbault. To the casual
observer a drawing of this kind simply represents some
men with their hats on, and he enjoys looking at the
hats collectively, while he may enjoy the
individual <span class="xxpn" id="p025">{25}</span>
faces; but the illustrator, with his practiced eye, finds
enjoyment in examining the way each individual hat is
drawn. You will find the same enjoyment if you practice
drawing hats as we have recommended, and it is
needless to say that your enjoyment will be profitable,
and, moreover, that your practice need not be limited
to the drawing of hats, but may embrace coats, gloves,
and shoes as well.

<p>If such is the influence upon your mind made by
this chapter, we feel sure that you will never regret having
read it and given the time to the practice we recommend,
and we think that the first step in the study of
drawing will have been made, and that you will feel it
has been a successful
one.</p>

<p class="pchaphead">MORE ABOUT HATS — PERSPECTIVE MAY BE LEARNED FROM THEM — DRAWING MORE
A MATTER OF SEEING PROPERLY THAN USE OF PEN — TEXTURE — SILHOUETTE
DRAWINGS USED BY EGYPTIANS.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">W<b>E</b> T<b>RUST</b></span>
that you followed the advice of our former
chapter, that you tried to draw a hat in
several positions, and that you then found, as we
prophesied, that you were led to observe the hats that
you saw in the street with a new sense of discernment;
if that is true, you will appreciate this chapter, we think,
though it be very short.</p>

<p>We select two more caricatures for you, in which we
find hats that are very similar. Now we can tell you
quite positively whether you have an eye for drawing or
not. Stop a moment, and before reading the next paragraph,
look at these hats, pages
<a href="#p028" title="go to p. 28">28</a>,
<a href="#p029" title="go to p. 29">29</a>, and argue out
the reason why they are drawn as they are; if your reasons
are somewhat like the following, your chances for
learning to draw are good; if not, you have much study
ahead of you, even before you can make a start.</p>

<p>Your observation is good if you realize that in drawing
almost anything you may represent it as a silhouette.
The Egyptians did much of their writing in hieroglyphs,
using silhouette pictures of thousands of different objects;
helmets and crowns, hands and feet, men and animals,
tools and utensils were employed as characters in their
alphabet; and if you see plainly how a silhouette is
made by outlining an object as it is seen from one
point <span class="xxpn" id="p027">{27}</span>
of view, usually a perfect side view, the object on a level
with the eye, and that the outline is filled in with black,
you may be sure that you have been observing correctly.
You will notice then that these two hats are (1) on a
level with the eye, for if (2) below the eye, you would
see the top of the crown and into the brim; if (3) above
the eye, you would see underneath the brim. You notice
also that the “Hedin” is the true silhouette, which is
made by leaving out the lights on the side, the suggestion
of the band, and the upper edge of the brim.
You will also notice (4), particularly in the “Jörgen,”
that the feet are as though the gentleman were walking
on a chalk-line on a table and the spectator sitting on a
low chair, so that the feet were on a level with his eye;
this is a characteristic feature of Egyptian hieroglyphs.
If the feet were drawn realistically they would not only
not be on a line one with the other, but we would seem
to look down upon the shoes, as ordinarily a man’s feet
are below the spectator’s eye.</p>

<p>We think that this is enough for one lesson, and if
you find that the propositions that we have numbered
are not clear to you, you would better work out the
problems on a sheet of paper. We take it for granted
that Nos. 1 and 2 are clear to anyone who drew the hats
according to our last chapter; but Nos. 3 and 4 may not
be so evident; if not, get a pair of shoes and put them
on the mantel on a level with your eye; next place them
upon the floor in the position in which one ordinarily
walks or stands, and our propositions will be clear to
you.</p>

<p>It is most important that you should understand all
these matters of optics, though it makes little difference

<span class="xxpn" id="p030">{30}</span> with what kind of a pen you may make your drawing.
Having mastered these principles, you would then
understand such a criticism on Engström’s work as the
following: Mr. Engström sometimes employs the pure
silhouette, as in the “Hedin,” and sometimes silhouette
in a modified form, as in the “Jörgen”; in the former
case an artist sacrifices rotundity, detail and texture (the
white streaks on the “Jörgen” hat suggest the surface
of the beaver; this we call texture; a felt hat has no
such white streaks upon it, and might be adequately
represented by a set of lines such as are used on Jörgen’s
coat, but no silhouette can suggest texture); in his caricatures
Engström unites with the silhouette effect the
single-plane effect of the Egyptian hieroglyphs. (The
hieroglyphs were mostly painted on walls and the feet
represented as though flush with the wall, and not one
farther from us than the other, hence we say that they
are on one plane.) Many caricaturists have effectually
burlesqued the Egyptian method of drawing and the
placing of their figures. The trousers and the cane in
the “Jörgen” drawing are the only objects in one
plane; the coat collar is distinctly rounded. In the
Moloch illustration we see also silhouette treatment.
You can easily imagine how Hedin’s hat, if the proper
size, would fittingly rest on Crispi’s
head.

<p class="pchaphead">HIEROGLYPHIC DESIGNS OR SILHOUETTES — THEIR USE AS TYPOGRAPHICAL
ORNAMENTS — OBJECTS SEEN AS ON ONE PLANE — PLACING YOUR
OBJECT — HORIZONTAL LINES PARALLEL TO THE EYE — HORIZONTAL LINES NOT
PARALLEL TO THE EYE.</p></div><!--chapter-->

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">W<b>E</b> P<b>UBLISH</b></span>
two kinds of drawings with this chapter,
which many be classified as follows: The
Grassets are hieroglyphic-like designs or silhouettes;
the Crispi, in his <i>robe de chambre</i>, which for want of the
artist’s name we shall call the <i>Don Chisciotte</i> cut—“Don
Chisciotte” you no doubt suspect is the Italian
for Don Quixote, and it is the name of a cartoon paper—is
a pure outline drawing.</p>

<p>Now let us take them in turn. Every printer will
recognize that the Grasset designs are excellent, for
they may be printed with greater ease than shaded
drawings, and their simplicity is in perfect harmony
with the solid black of type. Now, not only would
it <span class="xxpn" id="p033">{33}</span>
be pleasant for you as a printer to begin making some
such silhouettes, but it is very good practice in drawing
for you to search the house for objects that you
can put up against the window pane and draw their
contours, filling them in with black. A whisk broom,
a pair of scissors, a pair of eyeglasses, a leaf, a feather
may be put up against the glass and its silhouette
copied, and you then realize how many objects may be
represented by their contours. Later you learn how to
silhouette objects less flat; you may try the ink bottle
with a pen in it, the glue pot with the brush in it; this
leads you to such a thorough understanding of Grasset’s
flowers as pages of writing would never give. In walking
in the streets after such an exercise you will notice
not only the “block” of a man’s hat (which we spoke
of in Chapter I), but you will notice what kind of a
silhouette it makes against the sky; then the shape of
the birds, the weather vanes, the church steeples as they
are “etched against the sky,” as the poets say, will
have a new interest for you.</p>

<p>In this practice of silhouetting objects you learn
something that is most important in more advanced
work. You learn <i>to see objects as on one plane</i>. We
fancy your knowledge of geometry is sufficient for you
to understand what we mean, but let us go over the
ground slowly so that it may facilitate our future explanations
of perspective problems.</p>

<p>By a plane we mean a plain, a flat surface. A table
top is a plane. But the plane the artist draws upon—say
a sheet of paper—though he may let it lie horizontal
on a table, is always considered a <i>vertical plane</i>,
corresponding to a pane of glass in a window. Now,
if <span class="xxpn" id="p034">{34}</span>
we are looking across the street, through the window,
we know that each receding cobblestone in the street
(though in one horizontal plane) is in a different <i>vertical</i>
plane from the others. If we wished to make the plane
a tangible one we could set up a pane of glass in front
of the nearest cobblestone, and then another pane in
front of the cobblestone across the street, then it would
be evident to anyone that these stones were in two
planes, would it not? Good! Now, if you should go
to the window and trace with a paint brush a picture of
these two cobblestones on the glass, you would draw
your picture on one plane, and that a <i>vertical</i> plane.
Well, that is just what the artist does when he draws a
picture by the eye. He may lay his paper horizontally
on a common table, or obliquely on a tipping drawing
table, or on an easel, but he does not draw the objects
as though seen through a horizontal or oblique plane
(except sometimes when he sketches from a church-steeple
or a hilltop), but on the contrary, the ordinary
drawing always represents objects as seen through a
vertical pane of glass and as they would be traced on
that pane, hence <i>reduced to one plane</i>.</p>

<p>Having read the foregoing two or three times we will
ask you to turn to the <i>Don Chisciotte</i> caricature. Has
it not a new interest to you? Do you not see immediately
that the legs of the bureau, though in reality some
few feet apart and so in different planes, are drawn on a
sheet of paper on one plane? Well, the second step
after you have learned to draw a simple form in outline
is to learn to “place” your objects and their receding
parts—as the legs of the bureau. It would be impossible
for me to overestimate the trouble this gives
the <span class="xxpn" id="p035">{35}</span>
beginner—such as the man who sees the factory viewed
at an angle as though it were seen from the front (see
Chapter I). But if perchance you can get it into your
mind that you must draw as though tracing on a window
pane, nay, better still, if you will dip a brush in
the ink and actually draw on the pane for several days,
you will soon have little need of puzzling over perspective,
and when you look diagonally at a rectangular
object—as the windows in a factory—you will see at
a glance that they are no longer rectangles, as in a front
view, but the lintels and sills actually seem to <i>tip</i> (in an
upward direction if below the eye, in a downward direction
if above the eye). Then you suddenly realize that
certain laws of optics come into play in making the very
simplest of views. You look at such a simple interior
as in the <i>Don Chisciotte</i> room and you recognize at once
that the lines in it which were horizontal in nature are
governed by three laws; the portière rod and the side
boards of the couch are drawn horizontal because the
artist sees them in a front view—they are parallel to his
eye—but the lines of the front of the bureau and the
floor line behind it run up because they are lines seen not
in front view, but seen diagonally, and they are below the
artist’s eye; but the top line of the mirror runs down
because it is above the artist’s eye.</p>

<p>From this chapter any reader with a mathematical
mind will have already deduced the facts of the following
rules of perspective, even if he has not formulated them
in precise language; but you might as well learn them
by heart, as they are applied every time you draw a
box, a table, a room, a railroad track, a street, etc.</p>

<span class="spncpg1">The student should practice drawing interiors
with the purpose of learning the theory of perspective from every
object drawn. The horizontal lines of the picture frame, for example,
tip in the opposite direction to the mantel, because they are above the
eye. Had the mantel been a few inches higher it would have been drawn
as a perfectly horizontal line.</span><!--spncpg1-->

one is standing directly in front of them, appear as horizontal
lines and are to be so drawn, they do not tip
either up or down whether below or above the eye.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>2. But when a horizontal line is no longer parallel
to the axis of the eyes, that is when it is seen diagonally, as the
floor line, the front of the bureau and the top of the
mirror, then it follows this law; if it happens to be just
on a level with the eyes, that is on the horizon
line, then it <i>is</i> horizontal to the sight and is so drawn; if
the mirror were hanging where it is in the <i>Don Chisciotte</i>,
but were cut off just on a level with Crispi’s eyes,
and the draftsman of the picture were just Crispi’s
height, then the base of the mirror would be drawn
horizontal. But when the lines are below the eye, as
the floor line and the bureau lines, then they seem to
run up to the horizon and are drawn slanting upward;
while if they are above the eye, as the top of the mirror,
they tip down to the horizon and are drawn slanting
downward—the end farther away from the artist
lower in the picture than the end nearer him. (See the
side buildings in the Sorbonne courtyard.)</p>

<p>It is advisable for the student of perspective to cut a
rectangular opening, not too large, say the size of this
page, in a piece of pasteboard, which he may hold at
arm’s length in front of him and look through as he
would through a small window. This will not only
frame his picture for him, but it gives him two horizontal
lines and two perpendicular lines, and he can
hold his pencil or his ruler against the face of the
frame <span class="xxpn" id="p039">{39}</span>
so that it just covers any straight line he wishes to draw;
and he will readily see that all vertical lines in nature
make his pencil run parallel to the sides of his frame,
while horizontal lines
if in nature parallel to the axis of his eyes, or if on a level
with his eyes,
make it run parallel to the base
and top. And then, best of all, he can hold his pencil
parallel to oblique lines which run away from him, and
they will appear parallel to the face of his frame, or in
one plane, as they would be in a drawing. This is very
helpful, as there is nothing so confusing to the beginner
as the lines which run away from him. (In looking up
a railroad track the rails seem to run away. You know
they are actually parallel, but to your eye they converge.
Not only that, but you know they are flat on
the ground, whereas, in a picture, you draw them
standing up. All this is at first very confusing.)</p>

CARICATURIST — BEGINNER ADVISED TO USE OUTLINE ONLY, BUT HE MAY

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">I<b>F</b></span>
I have been successful
in mak­ing every point clear
in my fore­going chap­ters the read­er now has such
a know­ledge of the art of draw­ing as will en­able him
to under­stand, (1) the power of an out­line, and (2) to
realize that one may become a tolerable draftsman if he
will train his eye to see the outline of an object as if
marked upon a pane of glass—that is, reduced to one
plane; and to realize, moreover, that (3) this learning
to see things in one plane involves some knowledge of
perspective, of which more anon; but for the present let
us leave outline and take up another branch of the subject.
In the Luque cartoon the helmet is
represented <span class="xxpn" id="p042">{42}</span>
in a new form. The careful observer will see instantly
that it differs materially from the helmet in the <i>Don
Chisciotte</i> cartoon, shown upon
page <a href="#p037" title="go to p. 37 ">37</a>.</p>

<p>Let us make an analysis of this difference. I contemplated
no pun when I wrote of a <i>material</i> difference.
Yet that is the main point of contrast. We guess that
the helmet of the major domo in the <i>Don Chisciotte</i> is
metal, but we only guess it. We argue that the Romans
wore metal helmets, hence we fancy this is one; but outline
rarely indicates texture (we mean by texture the
material of an object—wood, wool, stone, linen, etc.)
or color. But in the Luque we are very sure that the
helmet is of black leather. True, we surmise this only,
because we know that modern helmets are apt to be
either metal or black patent leather, and this one is too
dark for metal, and the high light upon it is just like the
white light on a black patent leather helmet. (When
the light falls on a rounded object there is nearly always
one place upon it where the light strikes, creating a
white light—no matter what the color of the object—which
artists call the high light. This is always more
apparent upon highly polished objects than upon rough
objects.)</p>

<p>Now, you see in the Luque we have a very different
kind of drawing from a pure outline like the <i>Don Chisciotte</i>,
or a silhouette like the Grasset. In such drawing
the outline is only the framework; after it is put in, the
labor is by no means over; to the contrary, every bit of
surface has to be covered with an appropriate tint, and
two different considerations decide how light or how
heavy this tint shall be: first, the consideration of light
and shade; secondly, local color. When the artist put
a <span class="xxpn" id="p043">{43}</span>
dark mass under Crispi’s mustache he did not mean to
suggest that Crispi had been eating blackberry jam, or
that he had a negro’s lower lip, but he meant to represent
the strong shadow that a thick mustache throws upon a
lower lip when the light comes from above; in doing
this he noted a “thrown shadow.” When, however,
he made the dark line on the lower part of the chin
he did not mean to suggest that the upper part of the
chin threw a shadow on the lower part, but he represented
the part of the chin that rounds under the jaw;
this is called a “modeling shadow.” (A circle may
represent a ring, or a disk—as in the medal inscribed
<i>Literis et Artibus</i> in the Fallström
(page <a href="#p044" title="go to p. 44">44</a>)—or a
sphere; but without shading it is said not to have modeling;
and if it is intended for a sphere, it can only suggest
a sphere; to make it fully represent one, we shade
it; then it is positively not a ring, nor a disk, if the
shading is properly done. This shading gives it rotundity,
or bulk, and this effect we designate as modeling.)
When Luque makes the part of the visor of the helmet
to our right darker than the part to our left and leaves a
light between, he also models—that is, represents modeling
or rotundity; but when he makes both the shaded
side and the lighter side dark, and also makes Crispi’s
coat black, then he is said to represent local color.</p>

<p>Here you see we have a very advanced form of drawing,
and a form I should not advise you to employ in
your early efforts to do professional work; if you essay
to make a cartoon for your paper, I should advise you to
confine yourself to outline or silhouette. But in order
that you may fully understand a drawing which at first
appears to be outline, but which upon examination
turns<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="spncntr">By John Everett Millais.</span>
<span class="spncpg1">This is not a careful study, but shows an artist’s
method of “placing” objects. The right-hand figure is
evidently that of a minister, and the artist at first
intended to have his coat fall over his left thigh
but afterwards changed it. The gray lines which thus
place the skirt of the coat are those referred to in
Chapter V. In the left-hand figure the head was drawn
first and the hat added. It is interesting to note
how low upon the head the hat rests. The mistake of
the beginner is usually to put a hat too high on the
skull. (Or perhaps the artist’s first intention was to
draw a derby hat, which was afterwards changed to a
high hat.)</span><!--spncpg1-->
</span><!--spncaption-->

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
<span class="xxpn" id="p046">{46}</span> out to be partly shaded, we have introduced in these
first chapters this question of modeling and local color.
We have pointed out (Chapter II) that Engström sometimes
uses pure outline, sometimes outline and silhouette,
and sometimes outline, silhouette and shading.
His “Fallström,” given with this chapter, is without
silhouette effect, but is in outline, shading and local
color. The medal referred to is a piece of pure outline.
Ordinarily, when an artist draws a thing of this kind—a
button, a policeman’s badge, etc.—he makes the
lower line a little heavier than the rest so as to suggest
the shadow the object throws upon the coat; but Engström
has omitted this. In the nose, however, we have
not pure outline, but a distinct broadening of the line
under the nose giving the same suggestion of its protruding
and of its throwing a shadow as does Crispi’s
mustache in Luque’s drawing. In the hat, moreover,
we have both modeling—very good modeling, too,—and
local color.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>You should be reminded that Engström is a caricaturist,
and takes liberties with the art of drawing as well
as with his subjects. The example we gave in Chapter
I, his own portrait, was a perfectly consistent drawing,
all pure outline; so was the “Hedin” (Chapter II),
because silhouette goes perfectly well with outline. But
to model a hat as fully as in this “Fallström” drawing,
so that under its rim is a shadow, and yet not have it
throw a suggestion of a shadow upon the man’s head, is
most inconsistent drawing—permitted the caricaturist
only. If you were making such a study from nature
you would surely see a <i>thrown</i> shadow on the head and
you should put it
in. <span class="xxpn" id="p047">{47}</span></p>

<p>While I say you should not employ shading and
local color to any great extent in your early work, yet
you may study the theory of it so as to use it sparingly,
and that study is best pursued by putting on a table a
group of objects of different colors and textures; put a
white box beside a brown book, an ink bottle beside
a glass, a teacup beside a brown stone jug, and draw
each object in relation to the others. Make your ink
bottle blacker than your brown jug, but note that
both have distinct high-lights upon them. The white
box will probably not have a high-light upon it, but one
side of it may be all light, while the corresponding side
of the brown book will be darkish, though lighter than
its side in shadow. (We suppose that you place your
table near a window so that the light from it falls on one
side of the objects, the other side being in shadow; this
is the best arrangement for objects studied for their light
and shade. Do not have light come from other windows.)
You, therefore, in your drawing, have white
paper to represent the light side of the box, but you put
on a slight tint to represent the light side of the brown
book. The ink bottle you will treat very much like
Luque’s helmet; black as it is there will be streaks of
white upon it—sometimes high-lights, and sometimes
reflection of the window as seen in a mirror. If the
cover of the box, because it projects a little, throws a line
of shadow upon the side of the box, you will instantly
recognize that this is the same kind of a thrown shadow
as that which Luque put under Crispi’s mustache and
Engström put under Fallström’s nose. Some study of
this sort will soon train your eye to see the reason of
<i>spots of light and dark</i> in artists’
drawings. <span class="xxpn" id="p048">{48}</span></p>

<p>One of the points we admire in an expert’s drawing
is the use he makes of black spots. The Japanese have
rules of composition, governing this distribution of spots,
which they follow, balancing a black here with another
there in an admirable manner. In our chapter on wood
engraving we shall give some specimens of well distributed
blacks. In our tailpiece by Grasset you will notice
how on the right-hand side five petals and two buds
balance a tri-parted leaf on the opposite side. One of
the problems for the designer of printers’ devices is to
balance them properly. It is much easier to copy a
spray from nature and fill it in with black ink than it is
to make that spray balance so that when placed at the
end of a chapter or used to divide paragraphs it will
balance as perfectly as the letter V or A. It is needless
to note that every printer realizes that paragraphs might
be separated by the letter I or A or V, but not properly
by the letter B or D or E.</p>

some of my readers ask, “Is there not
something a teacher should tell us that will help
us whether we are drawing in outline or whether we are
shading—something that will teach us <i>how to begin</i> any
kind of a drawing?” The reply is “Yes,” and I propose
to give such help in this chapter; but it has
purposely been delayed till now, because I wished to
emphasize the fact that the principal thing is not for me
to tell you how to draw, but for me to help you to learn
to see so as to know what to draw. For example, I
will ask the printer to insert a rule here in a horizontal
position, thus:<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="dctr05">
<img src="images/i049.png" width="348" height="13" alt="" /></span>
</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
This represents a mantelshelf seen in front view, or one
seen in side view exactly on a level with your eyes.
Now, it stands to reason, does it not, that anybody
can <span class="xxpn" id="p050">{50}</span>
draw such a line? What you need to be taught, is that
the mantel is to be drawn that way only under the
two circumstances mentioned. The moment you have
a side view of it when it is below or above the eyes, you
must draw it tipping. Tipping downward (away from
you) if above the eye; upward, if below. Thus, if
above the eye:</span><span class="spnpbk">

<span class="dctr05">
<img src="images/i050a.jpg" width="348" height="37" alt="" /></span>
</span><!--spnpbk-->

<span class="spnpg0">(A, the end nearer spectator.) Thus, if below:</span>

<span class="spnpbk">
<span class="dctr05">
<img src="images/i050b.jpg" width="348" height="33" alt="" /></span>

</span><!--spnpbk--></p>

<p>This difference in the direction of line according to
the position of the spectator is something the novice
does not see, and it is the business of the teacher to
point it out. Hence the many references to seeing and
the few to drawing which are found in our foregoing
chapters.</p>

<p>But there is a suggestion about drawing which I will
give you that will help you at the first stage of your
study. It is this: Accustom yourself to place something
on your paper—some form having a height and
a breadth—that resembles the big proportions of your
subject, before you attempt to finish any single part of it.</p>

<p>Our illustrations clearly show the working of this
method. In the Herkomer study the lower parts of the
tree trunks are not finished, they are merely placed.
The outlines of the trunks show (1) the relation of the
two trunks to one another, (2) their size, and (3) their
direction. With the same simple means the artist could
have shown contrary facts; for example, that (1) the
trees were nearer together, (2) that the left one
was<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="xxpn" id="p051">{51}</span>

<span class="spncaption">
<span class="spnillohead">STUDY OF PINE TREES BY HUBERT HERKOMER.</span>
<span class="spncpg1">The form above the lowest
branch, which looks something like a cloud, shows
us the artist’s method of “placing” a branch before
finishing it; also the lower parts of the trunks show
their placing. All objects should be thus outlined
before they are shaded.</span><!--spncpg1-->

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
<span class="xxpn" id="p052">{52}</span> wider than the right, (3) that they tipped at an angle
of fifteen degrees to our left.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Again, the mass that at first glance looks like a
cloud, is really the “placing” of a branch. Now,
before the artist put any of the black in his picture,
which suggests the dark colors of a pine, he placed all
the principal branches, limbs, and the trunks of the two
trees, just as you see them in the unfinished places we
have pointed out. The reader should need very little
more help than this to fit him to go out to nature and
begin a landscape.</p>

<p>Almost any element you may see can be begun in
this manner. (I use the word element to cover either
one object or a group of objects; we say of some picture
that it has four elements: a foreground, a pine tree, a
clump of trees and distant hills.) For example, without
the line representing the limb below Herkomer’s outline
for the unfinished branch might almost stand for a
cloud—its outline would then simply be a little less
toothed. Its upper part might also stand for a group
of distant trees. Now, this branch, no less than the
trunks, has its big proportions; it is almost twice as
long as it is high, and no amount of pretty drawing of
details would ever represent <i>that</i> branch if you should
start out with a form twice as high as it is wide. Always
look out for these dimensions at first. The branch also
has a <i>direction</i>—the direction of its axis—which is
downward to our left, and no amount of pretty drawing
of its details would ever represent <i>this</i> branch if it were
represented with a horizontal axis. (The axis of the
lowest branch is at a still greater angle; this downward
tip is characteristic of the lower branches of the pine,
larch, elm, beech, willow, etc.) Now, a cloud has

cloud which lies horizontal as though it were a cirrus or
a cumulus cloud blown upward by a contrary wind. In
the placing of an element, then, it is not the margin of
the outline we think of, but the positions of objects,
their general bulk, and the direction of their axes.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>In the figure studies we reproduce by Bonnat and
Munkacsy, you can plainly see that the action of the
figures is graphically portrayed without any attempt at
detail, simply by “placing” the parts of the figure in
the right place. A good beginning in the case of figure
drawing should always show the action; that is to say,
show that the man is stooping over, leaning back, standing
upright or sitting down, long before the drawing
shows that his coat is black or has four buttons on it,
or that he has finger nails on his fingers.</p>

<p>It is nearly always the practice with artists to place
objects in this way with a pencil line, even if the subsequent
drawing is to be in pen or wash. Let your lines
be light, and then you can erase them after your ink
lines are put over them. Do not be afraid of feeling
your way with lines; put down several until you get the
right one. Do not expect to get your work right at
first. If you get in a branch of a tree and think it is
correct, leave it till the tree is complete; but if in the
end you see it is too large for the rest of the tree, rub it
out and make it smaller. Every artist has to do this
many times if his subject is at all
complicated.</p>

difficult
for the amateur to realize the value of a
line as fully as the art student realizes it. We give
an illustration of the first laying in or placing of a figure,
as done in the Parisian art schools. The student
who works for months and months in this manner sees
a meaning in an artist’s lines that the casual observer
misses. Here, for example, all the lines on the arm
represent swellings which are not merely temporary but
are organic, belonging to every arm. So also with the
cross lines on the abdomen; they are not as one might
expect, chance lines, but divide the trunk into organic
parts. Any model taking this pose would show some
such lines, or rather the body would divide itself
into <span class="xxpn" id="p058">{58}</span>
some such parts which would produce the wrinkles
which these lines represent; no matter whether he were
older or younger, stouter or thinner, the markings
would be in about the same place. When we come to the
analyzation of the human face this fact of representing
parts of the body by lines that are not outlines—i. e.,
not contour lines—will be still clearer to you. Now,
the point we want to make is that the method of
“placing” objects, recommended in the last chapter,
is not a mere process of procedure in drawing, but is
quite as important a mental training as the making of
the most intricate outline—in fact, for the printer-draftsman
it is more important than the latter. If you wish
to make a poster design, it is better that you should
know how to place “the elements” of a branch of
oak or ivy than that you should draw the venation
of the leaves or the delicate modeling of the stems,
because if printed in flat tones it is the big characteristics—showing
the difference between an ivy leaf and
an oak leaf—that you need to secure. Therefore, in all
your preliminary sketching do not work carelessly just
because you are finally going to rub out your placing
lines; but rather try to see how much likeness to the
object you can get by the most economical means, in
your very placing of the object. In the man’s arm, for
example, even the inexperienced draftsman, who might
not see the correctness of the drawing in the man’s
trunk, can realize that we have here the swelling of the
deltoid, the curve of the biceps, the extreme width at
the elbow, and the inside lines which mark bones and
muscles at the elbow; all of which represent the synthesis
of <i>the</i> human arm, though perhaps not the
similitude <span class="xxpn" id="p059">{59}</span>
of any <i>one</i> arm. Were you, with an artist companion,
looking over a collection of drawings by the masters
you would be surprised at his delight in many drawings
that were carried little further than this study of
an arm. The Japanese are celebrated for their synthetic
drawing; they have the ability to make a spot of green
that is not a lily leaf in all its intricate detail, but which
has all the characteristics of a lily leaf which distinguish
it from every other kind of leaf, stand for a perfect lily
leaf.</p>

<p>If you will turn to the Grasset design on
page <a href="#p039" title="go to p. 39">39</a> you
will realize that his wisteria is by no means a complete
floral drawing, but simply gives the characteristics of
the wisteria in its silhouette. Here you see we revert to
the subject of our second chapter, and recommend that
in placing your objects you think of them as silhouettes.
This wisteria design suggests another help for the beginner.
The flower itself in its entirety takes the form in
nature of a cone, which in silhouette is a triangle; the
entire branch of the ornament on
page <a href="#p048" title="go to p. 48">48</a> takes the
form of a triangle; and since geometrical forms are more
easily analyzed than natural forms, it might be well for
you to train yourself to notice if an object takes the
general form of a quadrangle or a rectangle, a triangle
or a polygon. The branches of trees can frequently
be mapped out into triangles or polygons with not
more than five or six sides, that are very easy to
recognize.</p>

<p>We have made a tracing of the pine trees by Mr.
Herkomer, in which we have mapped out the branches
into polygons, A, B and C
(page <a href="#p060" title="go to p. 60">60</a>). The lines D&nbsp;E
and F&nbsp;G are added to suggest how the tree trunks
are<span class="spnpbk">

</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>We wish to say, however, that we do not consider it
advisable to reduce freehand drawings to geometrical
forms to too great an extent. The art student in Paris
does not think of his model as a combination of cubes
and cylinders, but as a human figure; nor when he
leaves the atelier does he consider a tree as a combination
of cylinders and cones, but as an oak tree, or a
maple or a pine; and whether his drawing is a moment’s
jotting in a sketch-book, or a week’s study on canvas,
he tries to get as much of the characteristics of the pine
tree or the oak, in the moment or in the week, as his
perception will allow.</p>

<p>You would be surprised, if you practiced this method
for a few months, to see how much meaning these first
polygons will have to you. If you will map out an elm
tree, for example, and then turn to our diagram No. 2,
you will instantly recognize that the forms A, B, C,
could never be intended for an elm. This negative recognition
would be followed by positive recognition, and
you would guess at least, if you were not sure, that, in
a sketch of a sea coast, certain polygons put more on
one side of a line than on the other, which represented
a tree trunk, were meant for the branches of a
pine!</p>

<p>We give with this chapter also, two illustrations
showing the manner in which shading is done in the
art schools, but the main thing I wish you to note
about the illustrations is, not the shaded drawing, but
the drawing where the shadow is blocked in, Fig. A.
Now, this is important to bear in mind: A line is used,
not only for drawing the outside outline or <i>contour</i> of
objects, but for drawing the outline of shadows <i>upon</i>
and within them; therefore, every bit of practice you
may have in drawing lines of any kind will be helpful to
you when blocking in the shapes of shadows that bring
out the form of an object. It is just as imperative, for
example, that you compare the inside <i>margin of the
shadows</i> upon the wrist (as indicated in Fig. A) with
the plumb-line, so as to see their direction, as it is that
you compare the trunk of the Herkomer tree with the
plumb-line, that you may get its direction. (In obtaining
the direction of small shadows the artist very frequently
uses his pencil, held vertical, as a
plumb-line.)</p>

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p069">{69}</span></div>

<p>We give another illustration that we trust will interest
you, the very beautiful drawing by Fantin-La-Tour.
Our object in giving this is twofold: first, to show you
the drawing of the cast. We have said that the Bargue-Gérôme
studies show how students learn to work in
Paris. The truth is that nearly all over the world art
students learn to draw from white plaster casts on which
the shadows are very distinct. The eye is thus trained
to see <i>form</i>, as we call it. And it will not be difficult
for you to look from the cast drawing in the La-Tour
to the head of the standing girl, and see how the form
of her face is brought out by shading in the same manner
as in the cast.</p>

<p>In publishing a drawing of this kind in a book for
printers we do not recommend it as an example of drawing
for the press (though it would be an excellent guide
for lithography), but it is full of interest in that it exemplifies
what artists consider artistic draftsmanship. It is
evident that the author of it has studied in an art school
and that he gets his effects, not by chance, but by deliberation.
He is sensitive to the different degrees of darks
upon the several objects. No matter how plainly he
may see the shadow upon the cast, he knows that, in
order to represent it as a light object, such shadows
must <i>not</i> be black. So there is a vast difference between
its dark tones and the dark tones of the block on which
it stands. Also in drawing the human face he concentrates
his darks about the eyes, nose and mouth; the
rest of the face is shaded with great delicacy, for he
knows that if he puts darks elsewhere he will get the
undesirable effect of an old face. The printer is not
expected to carry his art as far as this, but we must
say <span class="xxpn" id="p070">{70}</span>
frankly that his degree of success depends entirely upon
the extent of his knowledge of the truths herein stated.
One need not go to an art school to see that a cast is
white, and that its shadows are not as black as the
shadows upon a bronze; but unless he trains his eye by
observation to see this difference in other things, no
tricks of pen-technic will help him when he comes to
draw a white horse, or a white collar. He does not have
to study portraiture in an art school in order to make a
drawing in pen and ink, for his paper, from a photograph;
but unless he will train himself to observe so
that he realizes that in a young face the greatest darks
are limited to the eyes, nose, and mouth, he will be
likely to make his pen-portrait look more like an old
person than a young person, even though in executing
the same he imitates the most perfect pen-technic.</p>

<p>Now, as the placing of the shadows in the seated
girl’s face is not the same, it is a little difficult for you
to realize that it contains the same kind of drawing as
the blocked-in cast hand and head.</p>

<p>But the eye becomes trained from drawing casts to
see the most delicate modeling of shadows, and the
seated girl’s face is really a complex style of drawing,
of which the cast head and hand are simple specimens.
I mean by “complex style of drawing” a method of getting
effects by imitating the light and shade upon objects,
as opposed to mere outline style or silhouette style.</p>

<p>Now, therefore, this illustration should indicate to
you that it is well to draw from casts, as art students do,
if you wish to make finished pictures in black and
white.</p>

<p>In the foregoing statements I have been careful
in <span class="xxpn" id="p071">{71}</span>
my language. I do not say students <i>all</i> over the world
learn to draw in light and shade, for there is a great
deal of wonderful Japanese art that is done entirely
without knowledge of light and shade
of the sort most usual in Occidental modeling.
Nor do I say
that you <i>must</i> draw from casts to learn to see light and
shade, because during the middle ages many great artists
learned to draw from life and not from casts. The
cast is a comparatively modern art-school accessory.</p>

<p>Another reason for giving this La-Tour drawing is
that it brings us a step farther into the consideration of
values; we notice that in it the cast appears to be white,
the girls’ faces and hands lighter than their gowns, and
one girl’s hair lighter than the other’s. Now, when an
artist makes a difference between the degrees of the
color of objects, we say he notes their values.</p>

<p>Bear this in mind, then, that mere shading is not
the end of drawing. You can go a step farther and
indicate the color value of a shadow, of which more
hereafter.</p>

il­lus­tra­tion
by Dag­nan-Bou­ver­et we find most
in­ter­est­ing in­di­ca­tions of how an ar­tist works; and
this head may serve as a connecting link between the
chapter on outline and the one on shading. The hat is
a beautiful piece of outline drawing, which, however,
was not meant for an outline drawing. It is simply to
serve as the placing of the hat, which would afterward
be shaded as are the face and mustache. The
eyes, <span class="xxpn" id="p074">{74}</span>
nose and mustache were first outlined in this way, and
you will recognize, I think, that this is the same kind
of drawing as that of which we treated in our first
chapters, though, of course, the hat is not all in one
plane.</p>

<p>But before you can thoroughly appreciate the drawing
of the face it is necessary that I should explain a
little further the study of drawing as it is taught in the
art schools. This I will do with the help of the Lœwe-Marchand
cut. In this, we see the method pursued in
almost all art schools the world over: a method based
upon cast drawing. It is found from experience that
students learn to see form more prominently from a plaster
cast, which is white, than from natural objects; and
it is found that the best results are got if the students
are taught to see the big shadows of an object rather
than the multitude of minor shadows which may be
seen upon close scrutiny. So the student is told not to
look for these minor shadows, but to half close his eyes,
and stand a good distance away from the object—say
three times its height—and look for the form that he
sees when the object becomes to his half-closed eyes
nothing more than a mass with a light and a dark side.
You can imagine that after a person has learned to get
the effect of a hand and a foot, as in the illustration in
Chapters VII and X, by merely noting the shape of the
one big shadow, that it is not difficult for him to go
farther and put in the minor shadows by opening his
eyes and examining the object more closely; and that
when he has learned to do this for several months, or
perchance several years, in the antique class, and then
for as long, or longer, in the life class, that he has
become<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="spncpg1">This drawing was doubtless made on a sheet of
charcoal paper, possibly gray in color, and was then
photographed for the direct process; and then, in
order to indicate the gray paper, the photo-engraver
tinted the zinc plate with a Ben Day film, which
gives the stipple result. The cross lines in the
corner indicate that after the artist made his study
he wished to enlarge it upon a canvas preliminary
to painting, which was done by covering the drawing
with squares and adding a diagonal to the same. These
squares and diagonals were repeated on a larger scale
on the canvas and the drawing enlarged freehand by
placing the different points of the original in the
corresponding triangles on the canvas. This method of
enlarging drawings has been used for five thousand
years.</span><!--spncpg1-->

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
<span class="xxpn" id="p076">{76}</span> so sensitive to seeing shadows that it is not difficult for
him to discern them upon anything and everything.
Now, that is the secret of the beautiful drawing of the
mustache in the Dagnan-Bouveret drawing. The beginner
draws the hairs of the mustache, and tries to get
his effect in that way; but you cannot by drawing the
pelt of a fox on a barn door get the effect of one with a
real live body underneath it. The result in this drawing
is due entirely to Dagnan-Bouveret’s sensitiveness to
light and shade. The lines, which the casual observer
would take to be the hairs of the mustache, are really
the shadows thrown by the groups of hairs as they part
here and there. It is true that if he were etching this
head or drawing it with a fine pen, he might in finishing
it put in a few hairs, and even Albrecht Dürer would
sometimes get a good effect by drawing the hairs of the
mustache or the curls on a head. But in nearly all
modern work, the hair, mustache or beard is considered
as a mass receiving light and shade, and is so treated,
there being no great difference between the golden hair
of a child and the white hair of an old woman.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>In the beautiful study by Gaillard we see the shape
of the skull under the woman’s hair, and there is a very
great difference between the part that is in shadow
around her ears and the part that is light on the top
of her head. This does not mean that the hair was
gray on top, and black around the ears, but it means
that the light struck the hair on top, while it did not
strike it on the sides.</p>

<p>Now, if you can give yourself the time to study from
the cast, or even from simple pasteboard boxes, so that
your eye will become sensitive to these graduations
from<span class="spnpbk">

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
<span class="xxpn" id="p078">{78}</span> light to dark, you will soon realize that, while in your
drawing for printing you may never in a hundred years’
practice draw anything so delicate as the Gaillard, yet
in your simplest drawings you may put in practice the
theory upon which it is made. For example, if you are
drawing an old woman’s head, even if you only use four
or five lines to represent her hair, you will not press upon
your pen when you are doing her hair on the top, but
you will press upon it when you come within the region
of the ears; and that pressure, though it will not represent
hairs, nor the actual value of the shadow, will yet
give <i>the difference</i> between the light on the top of the
head and the shadow behind the ears, and this will suggest
to the educated eye the roundness of the cranium.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Now we reproduce also the rough Watts drawing.
Let us contrast these two drawings. The one is almost
as finished as it can be, the other slight; yet I want
you to realize why I recommend this slight drawing
to printers and tell you that it is artistic. It is so
because in the very heavy lines that you see in the
ear, beard and coat there is knowledge of modeling.
The artist knew his business just as Gaillard did, and
every time he put down a blotty line it was meant to
represent the presence of a shadow. This face is from a
photograph; hundreds of delicate tones have been left
out; and the white hair of the beard is modeled with
nothing but thin and heavy lines while the shadows of
the photograph were delicate gray tints! A clever penman
drawing from a photograph uses darks which the
uneducated eye will take to be arbitrary blackening of
the drawing, but which an artist knows are the result of
intelligent observation.</p>

that the skull-cap is not represented partly gray and
partly black because the artist meant to indicate
a cap that was one color in front and another in
the back, but he meant to show the rounding of the
cranium, just as Gaillard did in varying the tones in
the hair of the old woman.</span><!--spncpg1-->

<p>Now, in the Gaillard drawing you see a very delicate
line running diagonally from the wing of the nose almost
to the corner of the lips. This is called the naso-labial
line, and is found in every old face. I say again, that
though you work for one hundred years as a printer
you would probably never draw a delicate line like this.
But if you should make studies in pencil and realize
that this line is typical of old age, you would be able
to put it in such a drawing as the Watts (the artist has
used two lines to represent it), where, you will notice,
it comes down about as far on the lower lip as in the
Gaillard, and you would realize why it was left out in
the Dagnan-Bouveret and Marchand younger subjects.</p>

<p>This chapter should be exceedingly interesting to
you as indicating two things—one discouraging and
the other encouraging. First, that when students of art
have the opportunity to work so beautifully, as in the
Bargue-Gérôme studies, and afterward from life, as in
the Gaillard, they needs must see more than you do,
and you must not expect to equal them if you, a busy
printer, can only practice a few evenings a week.
Therefore you should not attempt subtile renderings
like the Gaillard, but should confine yourself to simple
means. On the other hand, when I tell you that this is
about all the study there is gone through with in an art
school (I say about all, for besides blocking-in, students
learn a good deal about values; this we shall treat of in
a succeeding chapter), it should be interesting to you to
realize that if you will simply train yourself to see light
and shade like the plinth in the foot studies given in
Chapter XII by drawing a pasteboard box, and then
afterward draw from life, so as to see that hair is
darker <span class="xxpn" id="p081">{81}</span>
in shaded portions than in light ones, and that in an old
person the naso-labial line is marked and shows darker
than the cheeks, you will, when copying a photograph
for your paper, no matter how roughly you work, be
able to indicate the shadows in the hair and the dark
naso-labial line, as in the Watts portrait. This, I say,
should encourage you, and it is the only way for you
to learn to draw.</p>

the subject of Chapter VIII. We
give a fine drawing of an old man’s head by
Knaus, and we will ask you to look at it and see if
you cannot realize two things about it—first, that no
matter how many lines there may be upon the hat,
which make it look battered and different in texture
from a new silk hat, it was first drawn as was the
Dagnan-Bouveret given in the last chapter; secondly,
do you notice the oblique naso-labial line, which we
spoke of in connection with the Gaillard and Watts?
and do you realize one of two things from this also, that,
either this line in the original drawing ran up to the
wing of the nose but was lost in the several engravings,
or else the artist wished to indicate that his model was
not a very old man, and he did not make the line very
strong in that place? If so, you have learned some
important principles that will help you in drawing, for
you will be able to sketch any hat you wish to draw by
the same process that the best artists employ. Again,
you will be able to use proper judgment in introducing
the lines into a face. If, for example, you were copying,
in pen-and-ink, chalk-plate or wood
engraving,<span class="spnpbk">

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
<span class="xxpn" id="p084">{84}</span> from some half-obliterated etching or from some faded
daguerreotype, an old man’s head like the Knaus, you
would have the knowledge back of you that would permit
you to draw in the naso-labial with proper accentuation.
If you knew the original was a centenarian you
would most certainly continue the line up to the wing of
the nose and draw it continuously without a break; or if
he were but a sexagenarian of whom the biographical
dictionaries said “he carried his years lightly,” you
might purposely break this line as in the Knaus.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>So far, so good. And now for some other lines
in the face. At the base of the nose we have the
shadow of the nostril, and the curved portion of the
nose around it called the wing of the nose; these
are nearly always introduced into drawings. In the
Knaus they are very happily drawn. Revert to the
illustrations of the last chapter, and see if you can find
them. In the Marchand and Gaillard they are represented
by modeling rather than lines, but they are
outlined in the Dagnan-Bouveret and the Watts, the
former being in pencil. We notice that one of these
objects is grayer than the other; which is it? It is the
naso-labial line, and the shadow of the nostril is much
the darker. The same effect is got in the Watts by
using a fine line for the naso-labial line and a thicker
line, or a blot, for the nostril. If, therefore, you were
drawing the Gaillard in line, can you not realize that
you would approximate the effect of our half-tone by
making the outline of the wing of the nose the lightest
of your lines, the naso-labial line darker, and the shadow
of the nostril the darkest of the three? This order
can <span class="xxpn" id="p085">{85}</span>
usually be followed in drawing an old person, and in
almost every case (young or old) the nostril shadow is
the darker of the three lines mentioned. In regard to
the nostril being sometimes a line and sometimes a blot,
the difference lies in the character of the original; with
some persons the nostril is very straight and little of the
inside of the nose shows. This was evidently the case
in the Knaus original, so the artist uses a line and
nothing more for the nostril (you will, however, not fail
to note the subtlety of the artist’s touch, which gives us
a strongly marked line for the nostril, but a more delicate
line for the wing of the nose). In the Dagnan-Bouveret,
however, the nostril goes up at quite an
angle, exposing much more of the inside of the nose
than in the Knaus; therefore, were you rendering this
drawing in pen-and-ink, you could use a blot in the
nostril similar in heaviness to that in the Watts portrait
on page <a href="#p079" title="go to p. 79">79</a>.</p>

<p>We should advise you, by the way, in following
these chapters, to make tracings of all our half-tone
cuts and render them in pen-line like the Watts; this
will help you immensely to understand an analyzation
of them.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">S<b>OME</b></span> of
the most valuable hints we have given our
readers are those of Chapters VIII and IX, in
connection with the naso-labial line. In these you will
find the foundation of our teaching—that is, we do not
say that a human face must be made by putting in a
black line running obliquely from the nose to the lip,
made with such or such a pen, such or such a crayon,
ink, or charcoal, but we point out the line in <i>nature</i>,
and say that because it is found in nature, artists put it
in their drawings. When not found in a face, as that
of a young person, then it is left out in a good artist’s
drawing of a young face. Whether he uses pen,
wash, <span class="xxpn" id="p087">{87}</span>
or crayon, has very little to do with the case. There
are some methods of using the pen, wash, or crayon,
that are better than others; but, if you are taught to see
the naso-labial line in nature, it is very easy to learn to
draw it in one of those mediums, and having drawn it
in one, it is easier to learn to draw it in other mediums.</p>

<p>We give, with this chapter, the head of Choudieu,
in which this line is marked as conspicuously as in the

Watts. This drawing might have been made with an
ordinary pen, somewhat worn, or (as was probably the
case) with a quill pen, or with a camel’s-hair brush, or
with a Japanese brush (which, like the quill pen, is a
delightful instrument with which to draw heavy lines);
but are we not right in surmising that you are better
prepared to draw such a head because we pointed out
in <span class="xxpn" id="p088">{88}</span>
the last chapter that the naso-labial line was a characteristic
mark of an old man’s face than if we had given
you directions for using the quill pen or the brush and
said nothing about this line? Of course, we do not
mean to suggest that, were you making a copy from <i>this</i>
line drawing, you would be so careless as to leave out
the naso-labial line, but if you were drawing an old
man’s face from a photograph, might you not easily
overlook this line if it had never been pointed out to
you? If you agree with this proposition you will be in
thorough sympathy with the spirit in which this work
is written, and when our chapter on expression comes
you will not at all regret that it is not a technical chapter
on the use of a drawing instrument.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Now, let us consider the Choudieu drawing a little
more fully, and in doing so we shall ask you to notice
that the words follow almost verbatim the part of
Chapter VIII referring to the Watts head. This does
not mean that we are at a loss for a vocabulary, but it is
done purposely so that we may thus call attention to it,
and that you may realize that we have called your attention
to a vital principle; moreover, that principle may
be referred to again and again in almost every case
where an old person’s head is under consideration.
We publish also the Duc d’Aumale drawing, in which
you will see the line is again marked. Now, we publish
this drawing mainly in connection with the highly
finished drawings illustrating Chapter VIII, by Dagnan-Bouveret,
Lœwe-Marchand and Gaillard, but you may
profitably note also that were you tracing it, intending
to make a line drawing of it in pen and ink, you

in the Watts portrait. You will not fail to notice also
the line in the throat corresponding to the one in Bonnard’s
Choudieu, now presented for consideration.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>This Bonnard is a slight drawing, but it is recommended
to printers because it is both artistic in treatment
and easily printed. It is artistic because in the
heavy lines that you see in the ear and hair there is a
knowledge of modeling. The artist knew his business
just as Gaillard did, and every time he put down a
blotty line it was meant to represent the presence of a
shadow. We have no means of determining whether
this was from an actual plaster or bronze medallion, or
whether the artist worked from a photograph and from
his imagination rendered the effect of a modeled relief;
but in either case, in the photograph or in nature, there
were thousands of little tones that have been left out.
A clever pen draftsman works in the same manner,
using darks which the uneducated eye will take to be
arbitrary blackening of the drawing, but which an
artist knows is the result of the intelligent observation
of the shapes of shadows, and of the most important
shadows of a face. Now, one of the most conspicuous
lines in this drawing is the one running diagonally from
the wing of the nose almost to the corner of the lips.
This is called the naso-labial line, and is found in every
old face. I say again, that though you work for one
hundred years as a printer, you would probably never
draw as correct a line as this. But if you should make
studies in pencil and realize that this line is typical of
old age, you would be able to put it in such a
drawing<span class="spnpbk">

about as far as the lower lip, as in the Gaillard, and you

and Marchand drawings.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>The Bonnat portrait of Cogniet becomes particularly
interesting from this view point, e. g., practice for the
sake of observation. It is executed by a process of no
value to the printer of the country newspaper, but there
is food for thought in the way the form is brought out
by the juxtaposition of masses of light and dark that
are not lines. Ordinarily we do not recommend to the
printer to experiment with such effects, but rather to
confine himself to outline or silhouette, but the value
of the white-line will be considered in connection with
wood engraving, and any practice in drawing from
nature in light masses will help you appreciate the judicious
use of white-line in wood engraving, or strong
contrasts of white and black in any medium. We publish,
for example, two very different kinds of drawing
as companions to the Bonnat. One in which Verdyen
has obtained an effect of the brilliancy of fireworks by
scratching out whites from a very black drawing. Similar
effects may be got with great ease in wood engraving.</p>

<p>A still more clear effect of light is got in the Bonnard
tailpiece, where, by simply breaking the window
sash with the light fold of a curtain, he makes us feel the
color of the curtain from the top to the bottom of the
picture. We should advise you to practice in any
medium, endeavoring to get similar effects, as they are
most valuable in saving a drawing from monotony. In
the Brun drawing, for example, no casual
observer<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="xxpn" id="p094">{94}</span> would appreciate the white pillars, and an untrained
draftsman would be likely to cover them with tones, but
as a matter of fact they help immensely to give variety
to the drawing. In an architectural exhibition we are
frequently tired by the monotony of similar drawings
where the draftsmen, in their desire to render texture
and local color, cover such surfaces with lines meant to
represent stone, brick or mortar.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>We would remark also that just as our own repetition
of the Watts analysis apropos of the Bonnard’s
Choudieu portrait was intentional, so the apparent conglomeration
of portrait studies, landscapes and buildings
is not the result of careless arrangement on our part,
but is intentional, that it may be shown that a certain
principle in drawing, studied from one object, may be
applied to any other. If you draw a friend’s face by
lamplight and pick out the lights upon it and his cuff,
as in the Bonnat Cogniet, you will be prepared to pick
out similar lights on portions of buildings as in the
pillars in the Brun drawing; or on window curtain folds
as in Bonnard’s tailpiece.</p>

<p>It may be interesting to printers for us to narrate the
difficulty of preparing a proper legend for the Choudieu.
It was a tailpiece to an article in a French magazine,
and bore no legend. To all appearances it was the
portrait of one Mr. Dangers, but knowing how liberal
the French are in their use of cognomens, we took the
precaution to investigate. A Frenchman may be born
Smith, but in manhood is known to the public by one
or a dozen other names. He may marry Miss Brown,
and, therefore, parade as Mr. Brown; his Uncle
Jones<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="xxpn" id="p096">{96}</span> may leave him money, so he publishes his articles under
the name of Jones; he was born in the city of Boston, so
he signs himself <i>de</i> Boston, meaning <i>of</i>, or <i>from</i>, Boston.
Under this name he paints his first picture, but the
town council does not buy his works as he hoped it
would, and the council of Albany does, so he discards
“de Boston” and, in his gratitude, he afterward signs
his canvases d’Albany (abbreviation of <i>de</i> Albany). But
now as to Christian names. Our friend Smith was, perhaps,
named by his father Henry, but at his baptism
there were added the names of Lewis and Charles and
his mother’s name, Black. Then, when at the age of
fifteen he comes to be confirmed, he takes the name
of Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, plus Mary. And with
any of his surnyms he may at any time combine any
two or half a dozen of these pronyms. So that a
French biographical dictionary is one-half biography
and one-half cross-reference. Thus—<i>Brown</i>, see <i>Jones</i>;
<i>Black</i>, see <i>White</i>.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Knowing this, we referred to the periodical from which this was cut,
and found it was a tailpiece to an article signed Pierre Réné Choudieu.
Ah! this gave us a clue; but, who then was Dangers? Was Choudieu a
sculptor as well as a writer, and was this a medallion portrait by
him of Dangers? Or was it a portrait of Choudieu by a draftsman named
Dangers? The artists were not mentioned in the index nor on any page
in the body of the magazine, but on the title-page we found “Dessins
de Pierre Bonnard,” meaning that the drawings in the magazine were by
one artist—Pierre Bonnard. Therefore, D’Angers could not have been the
artist, so<span class="spnpbk">

in it read, “Pierre Réné Choudieu, naquit a

us harp a little longer upon the naso-labial line.
We reproduce two very beautiful drawings by
Grellet, the one of a young girl, the other of an old
man. How suggestive is the old man’s head because
of the strong marking of the naso-labial line. Do you
not realize how easily you could draw this line, and the
whole head for that matter, in the manner of the Bonnard
Choudieu? But valuable as it is by itself, how
much more suggestive in connection with the young
girl’s head, where the naso-labial line is hardly perceptible.
This is a lesson in negation, at the value of which
we have hinted so often. It is your business to learn
when to put in a line, but equally your business to learn
when to leave it out. Therefore we give with this chapter
some heads of younger persons, that you may learn
this very lesson. Take the Fred Walker head. How
like the Watts drawing, so far as its treatment goes;
but the naso-labial line is missing. What is the
result?<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="spncpg1">
  Note entire absence of naso-labial line, and of line
  about orbicular muscles. Absence of these lines
  indicate youth. Contrast with the Watts and Choudieu
  heads, where strong markings are prominent because
  of advanced age of the subjects.</span><!--spncpg1-->
</span><!--spncaption-->

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
<span class="xxpn" id="p103">{103}</span> Why,
we have the characteristics of a younger man. In
this little comparison you have the foundation of all art
study. Drawing is not arbitrary; we do not introduce
lines into a face simply because this artist or that artist
did so; we introduce them because their counterpart is
found in nature. It is not in the province of these
papers, as we have said, to tell the printer how he
should draw every object he may attempt to delineate—a
waste-paper basket, the head of a cow, a printing
press, or a hat. But we can give him hints which will
help him to observe for himself the characteristics of any
object under the sun which he may wish to draw. If
he finds around the mouth of a cow more pronounced
lines than in a calf, he must put them in. If in one
trash basket the wickerwork runs upward with each line
parallel, he must draw it by perpendicular parallel lines,
while in another one the wickerwork is interwoven
diagonally and he must represent it by diagonal lines.
In a coat sleeve, the arm hanging down, there are but
few cross-folds, so he introduces few cross-lines into a
sketch of such a sleeve, but when the arm is bent many
more folds occur at the elbow and he therefore introduces
more cross-lines in his drawing of the sleeve.
This is about all there is to the science of drawing.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Now let us proceed a little further. In the Watts
we notice two or three lines below the lower eyelid;
these we find also in the Gaillard, but they are absent in
the Donatello Young Girl’s Head by Grellet; they are
very perceptible in the Brontolone. Here we have to
do with another muscle. In the human head the eye is

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
<span class="xxpn" id="p105">{105}</span> set in a cavity in the skull called the orbital orifice, and
in a very old person the lower edge of this cavity is
sometimes perceptible under the flesh, and occasions a
line in an artist’s drawing. But the main cause for the
lines around the edge of an eye is that the eye is surrounded
by a soft muscle, which is called the orbicular
muscle. The part of this muscle which forms the eyelid
is called the palpebral part; the part above the eyelid,
the superior orbital orbicular; and the part below the
lower eyelid, the inferior orbital orbicular. At the outer
corner of the eye, as the two parts come together, they
show in an old person’s face habitually, and in a child’s
face laughter creates radiating lines called crow’s-feet.
These lines called the crow’s-feet, and still more the
folds in the muscles below the eye between the lower
eyelid and the base of the orbital orifice are, like the
naso-labial line, very conspicuous in old age and almost
entirely absent in childhood. If you understand this
you will turn to the beautiful drawing by Lefebvre, and
realize why, although there is a great deal of shading on
the hair, ear and jaw, and quite a perceptible piece of
shading on the wing of the nose, there are no lines
down the cheek between the eye and the lips. Indeed,
in the original drawing, the white paper was there left
entirely uncovered. Of course, the artist might have
filled the entire space with shading, but in that case it
would have been a graduated tint suggesting the roundness
of the cheek, as in the Grellet Young Girl, but there
would have been no suggestion of lines; the moment
lines are introduced the characteristics of old age
are <span class="xxpn" id="p106">{106}</span>

suggested. At the corner of the mouth is a line which runs in about
the same direction as the naso-labial line. In youth the cheek is
slightly rounded out from the lip, and in a side view it is usually the
outline of the cheek
which makes the little line at the corner of the lips in the Lefebvre
and the Grellet Young Girl, and always in the side view of a baby’s
head; but as the head becomes less babyish it is the muscles of the
lips which cause this line. The muscles of the lips are exactly like
those of the eye; they run entirely around the lips, but at the
corner of the mouth, instead of having the radiating line like the
crow’s-feet, the threads of the muscle have a more perpendicular trend
and create a line running in the same direction as the naso-labial
line; while below this, but attached to it, is the triangular muscle of
the lips, or the <span class="xxpn" id="p107">{107}</span>
depressor of the angle of the lips; this, in the ordinary old
person, creates a long line, starting at the corner of
the lip, running down considerably. This line is very
conspicuous in the Brontolone, but absent in the Young
Girl and the Lefebvre. It is seen plainly in the Choudieu,
and we do not see how you can ask for a better
lesson in drawing than the comparing of the highly
finished Brontolone with the very simple
Choudieu!<br class="brclearfix" />
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Once more, above the eyes the forehead is covered
with the frontal muscle. The fibers run perpendicularly,
but when they contract, as when a person frowns,
the folds in the flesh run horizontally; these folds are
particularly perceptible in old age. Though every
mother will remember their alarming occurence in babyhood,
we do not associate them with youth; and so
in the Grellet Young Girl we find no lines in the forehead,
nor are they in the Lœwe-Marchand, hence a
placid temperament is suggested in that portrait. Many
men no older than Monsieur X. have constant lines in
their forehead, and the actor uses these muscles continually
for expression. We write the plural because
the muscle is frequently divided into right and left portions
which follow the direction of the eyebrows, so that
when the muscle is contracted the eyebrow’s are no
longer horizontal but have an M shape across the forehead.
In the Watts there is a very perceptible line
which curves over the right eye, taking the direction of
the eyebrow; this is part of the frontalis muscle. If the
line on the other side were completed it would take a
similar direction over the left eye.</p>

<p>We have thus covered the muscles of the face which
have most to do with expression, and so you see that,
besides drawing the eyebrows, eyelashes, eyeballs, the
bridge of the nose, the nostril, the lips, and the chin,
the artist has to do with a great many muscles, and the
novice must not only be warned about them, that he
may know when to introduce them, but he must remember
that they have principally to do with old age
or <span class="xxpn" id="p110">{110}</span>
abnormal expression (laughter, grief, hate, etc.), and
they must be used to express such attributes only.
Hence the three English drawings represent very admirably
the normal, placid expression of middle-aged men.

you say, perhaps, that you are not prepared to attempt
a portrait because we have given you no directions for

  Note that the skull-cap is not represented partly
  gray and partly black because the artist meant to

  An enlargement of this cut was given in Chapter

  nearer the lines come together, and their closeness

<span class="xxpn" id="p113">{113}</span> you may study with profit, but in order to draw a simple
portrait for your newspaper it is not necessary for you
to have any further instruction than we have given you.
If it is going to pay you to follow drawing at all, you
should be able at this stage of progress to make a tolerably
good drawing for a newspaper portrait. But, you
say, “What size should I make the drawing?” We
reply, “Almost any size, though usually not smaller
than the cut is to appear.” But that it may be smaller
is seen by our two Watts cuts. Here is a cut the exact
size of the original Watts, as it went to the engraver,
who by mistake enlarged it to the size it appeared
in Chapter VIII. I accepted this enlargement gladly,
so as to show you that a drawing may be enlarged
or reduced, but more especially with the idea of showing
you the usual size that a drawing is made for
reduction; for you will always be safe in making your
portrait the size of the Watts in Chapter VIII if you
wish it to appear the size of the present cut. I cannot
over-emphasize the importance of your realizing that
you have been told sufficient about pen drawing for you
to go ahead and make drawings for your paper. If there
is anything more to be learned I am candid in saying
that you are better able to find out what it is than I
am, for it is almost entirely a matter of printing, and not
of engraving. Photo-engravers can nowadays reproduce
almost any kind of a drawing, but a cut which
might print well in a magazine might not print at all
in your country newspaper. You know better than I
do the trouble of “bringing up” a fine cut on

  The parallel lines in the background represent a
  tint, and herein is the foundation of pen drawing,
  as distinguished from wash drawing: parallel lines
  are used to represent a tint; if they are farther
  apart they represent a lighter tint, if nearer
  together a darker tint; or again, if the artist
  presses on his pen more heavily on one set of lines
  than another, he can also get a darker tone without
  putting the lines any closer together. For newspaper
  work such a method is preferable to placing the
  lines near together; the Wyatt Eaton shows the

on a cylinder press, and when you are making
your drawing it is for you to keep in mind the kind of
paper it is to be printed on, and to keep your lines
sufficiently open accordingly. Ordinary intelligence
should be your guide. Let us take the Renard Grandmother
for an example; in the background is a series of
the simplest lines imaginable. If you should make your
drawing the same size as our cut, and the lines the same
distance apart, it could be easily reduced to an inch
wide, and print in a magazine, but it would not then
print in a country newspaper; the lines would be so
near together that they would fill up. The cut might
print in a city newspaper, but it is not likely. The
truth is that a printer can tell better about this than I
can. All I can say is that as a general thing a set of
parallel lines print better than cross-hatched lines.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>(In using the expressions, “a magazine,” “a city
newspaper” and “a country newspaper,” to represent
first, second and third class printing, I am well aware
that the distinction is an arbitrary and not a real one;
that sometimes by using good ink, good stock and by
printing <i>slowly</i>, the country printer can run a cut in his
newspaper with better results than can a city paper
using poorer stock and ink for the sake of economy,
and printing at lightning speed. But the reader will
kindly let the expressions stand for (1) perfect press,
good stock and ink, and expert overlaying; (2) perfect
press, ordinary “news” stock, poor ink, and little overlaying;
(3) poorest stock, ink, cheap press, and not
expert overlaying.)</p>

<span class="spnillohead">PORTRAIT OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.</span>
<span class="spncpg1">
  Drawn, probably with a quill pen, by Wyatt Eaton, in
  1888, the original 8 by 10 inches. The drawing was
  made in an open manner so that it would print on the
  poorest kind of paper, as it was used as a placard
  to announce a story by Stevenson, in the New York
  <i>Sun</i>. Reproduced by kind permission of the S. S.

<div><span class="xxpn" id="p117">{117}</span></div>

<p>Next to the preference of one set of lines to cross-hatched
lines, it is to be said that a dark is better
obtained by pressing on the pen than by putting the
lines near together. We publish a superb example of
pen drawing for newspaper work—the Stevenson, by
Wyatt Eaton. We believe that this is the <i>ne plus
ultra</i> of newspaper portraiture, for the lines are strong
and vigorous, there being no possibility of their running
together in printing. I should advise you to look
at this portrait under a magnifying glass that you may
realize how very simple the treatment is.</p>

<p>McClure’s “Human Documents” contains a baker’s
dozen of half-tones of Stevenson, from photographs.
You might procure this pamphlet and copy the half-tones
in pen, using the Wyatt Eaton as a guide.</p>

<p>(And in parentheses I would say you will notice
that the naso-labial lines on both sides of the face are
strongly marked, and yet instead of there being one
line going in the direction of the muscle, as in Bonnard’s
“Choudieu,” we have on the light side of the
face eight perpendicular lines, and on the shaded side
six blots with almost horizonal, but slightly oblique,
direction! Do you not, therefore, see that it is not the
kind of line you use, not a matter of “what way the
lines go,” but where you put your tones, that counts in
drawing? If Wyatt Eaton had not seen the strongly
marked naso-labial line on Stevenson’s face, he would
not have put these two triangular forms radiating from
the nostril. Moreover, Eaton could have represented
these lines in another way just as well. Also, it
would <span class="xxpn" id="p118">{118}</span>
take too long to explain other subtle features of this
drawing, but we would add that you will rarely see so
much tone on the light cheek as in this drawing. Stevenson
was an invalid, and this tone represents the
sunken cheek of ill-health.)</p>

<p>Now, if you will examine the Sickert portrait of Wilson,
you will find an equally artistic drawing, but one
not quite so adaptable to newspaper printing; for the
darks are partly obtained by putting the lines near
together rather than by great pressure, and in our
reproduction they have frequently run together where
in the original print, which was 6 by 9 inches, they were
separated. And so also in printing on poor paper;
there is a chance that the interstices will fill up, while
they would not in the Eaton.</p>

<p>As, however, this drawing was made for printing on
a thin manila paper, not on coated paper, and there is
great deal of pressure on the pen (note especially the
side of the nose), which was put on knowingly by the
artist, it contains much that should be imitated in newspaper
work.</p>

<p>In regard to the way to make such heavy lines, we
would say that it is a mere matter of practice; the
selection of pen has little to do with it. Excellent
results may be got by using a brush instead of the pen,
and we dare say that Mr. Eaton used a quill pen. But
as a matter of fact, the artist usually prefers to use a
very fine pen such as a crow quill, or mapping pen,
which is flexible, it thus being that a dark line is got,
not by a blunt-pointed pen, but by allowing the nibs

freely from it. For ordinary purposes a Gillot 303 or
170 is frequently used by the artists. But it is a matter
of practice mainly, and the pen you usually write with
is apt to be the best medium for practice at first. In
fact, we are particularly anxious to have our reader not
worry about pen technic. Let him realize that he
might wish to put his drawing upon the chalk plate, in
which case he would make a tracing of a photograph,
and, placing it upon the chalk, press upon it with a
hard-pointed pencil, and thus transfer his outline into
an indentation on the chalk. He would then take the
scraping tool and clear away the chalk wherever he
wishes a line. The fact being that he would introduce
lines only where he knew there should be lines in
nature, as in the case of the naso-labial line, the eyelids,
etc.; and he would broaden his lines only where
he knew the tones should be darker in nature than
where he had used a set of fine lines. There would be
no use of pen at all!
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>So you see we have come right to the milk in the
cocoanut—right to the matter this series was to teach.
Many readers no doubt were disgusted when they did
not find in our first chapters directions for the use of the
pen and a list of materials for pen drawing, but those
who may have occasion to do their portraits in chalk
plate will thank us for our hints on the study of nature
and the study of lines, no matter how
made.</p>

of parallel lines which, contrasted with the white
of the illumination thrown by the lantern, gives us
an effect of gray. This is found again in the other
drawing by Marchetti; and if you will study these
two drawings, and then turn to the Vierge, you will
find that nine-tenths of it is drawn in the same way.
Here and there to get a certain vibration of tone,
Vierge uses crosshatch, but you will notice that the
lightest gray and the intensest dark are got without
crosshatching.<br class="brclearfix" /></p>

<p>In the St. Elme you may also distinguish very clever
use of parallel lines, without much crosshatching. We
have purposely reproduced this, together with the page
it decorated, so that you may see the artist had a good
reason for not crosshatching; he wished his drawing
to form a decoration about the page, and he did not
want it to be too heavy, so he abstained from
crosshatching.<span class="spnpbk">

to begin with, that the less crosshatching in your
work the better it will print. Hence the Marchetti and
St. Elme drawings are given as examples.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>In the portrait of the painter Carrière, we have an
amusing example of the effective use of parallel lines.
Instead of giving us a black silhouette, the artist—Guillaume—has
given us a gray one, which suggests
the subject seen through a fog. Had the artist wished
to represent the palette as being of dark wood he could
have pressed on his pen lines and thus given us that
effect. Had he wished to show that the canvas was
lighter than the figure, he could have refrained from
pressing so heavily on his pen lines, or, better still, distributed
his lines farther apart and thus obtained the
effect of a lighter tone. Bear in mind, however, that I
used the term pen lines in speaking of this drawing
because the original was made in that medium, but the
same graduation or contrast of lines is applicable to
nearly all methods of line drawing; to etching and
chalk plate as well. You will, perhaps, have a better
grasp of the subject by thinking of it as—the theory of
tone imitation by lines.</p>

<p>When you have grasped the theory of this pen
technic, <i>alias</i> the representing of tone by lines, you

various specimens of illustration.</p>

<p>Some of our friends, for example, who might have
been interested in our first chapters and the specimens
of caricature given therein, may have been
disappointed <span class="xxpn" id="p127">{127}</span>
that we have given so much attention to portraiture
recently, so we have made an effort in this chapter to
give a <i>mélange</i> that will cover many fields of newspaper
illustration. In the Forain we have a splendid example
of such work. It was printed on very poor paper
stock, but it came out admirably, harmonizing with the
type, which is larger than that used in this country,
long<span class="spnpbk">

  makes fun of Mr. Berthelot, who has had, or expects
  to have, some dealings with England, for the visitor
  says, “May I see my honorable master?” and the maid
  responds, “Mr. Berthelot is not receiving; he is
  taking an English lesson.” The cut in <i>Figaro</i> was
  8 by 8, and it represents an excellent method of
  newspaper drawing, and one that could be easily
  imitated in chalk plate. We would also call
  attention to the drawing of the broom. Our readers

objects is particularly interesting. Look at the duster

would see if it were held up against the window and
viewed in silhouette?
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>A good example of a news illustration is given in the
Vallet page, which could easily be imitated in chalk
plate. The artist viewed a collection of English army
costumes, or witnessed a drill, and he shows us in very
simple lines the style of accouterment. Any newspaper
editor who could sketch tolerably well could do the
same thing for his county fair.</p>

<p>In the Moullier we have a specimen that is well-nigh
as amusing as the artist in the fog, for here we have a
pen drawing that is not made by lines, but by a series
of stipples. While the newspaper tyro should not
employ this technic too frequently in his practice, still,
realizing that the tone effect is graphically gained without
the use of the conventional line, it must quickly
dawn upon him that there are many technics, and,
having practiced drawing mantelshelves according to
the instructions in our early chapters, he will also appreciate
the fact that the artist was in front of this mantelshelf,
as the horizontal lines do not tip, and that the
shelf was higher than his eye, as the top of the mantel
is not shown. This knowledge gathered allows the
student to see that various technics may represent the
same truth in nature.</p>

<p>A good method of practice for pen work is as follows:

  Pen drawing by Marc Moullier, for <i>La Plume</i>,
  showing a clever and eccentric use of dots. It may
  be remarked that since the mantelpiece is above the
  eye we cannot see the top of it. It is parallel
  to the artist’s eyes, and so is represented as
  a horizontal line. So far as correct drawing is
  concerned, it makes no difference how that line
  is made. One artist makes it a thick line with a
  blunt pen, another a thin line with a fine pen,
  and another, like Moullier, makes it with a series
  of dots, but each of these methods is a matter of
  technic, and the rules of technic are arbitrary,
  not fixed as are the rules for drawing. You may
  invent your own technic, but you cannot invent

with a blue pencil, lay it on a sheet of bristol board or
paper, face upward, and go over the outline with a hard
pencil, using such a pressure as will transfer to the bristol
board a blue outline. The object in using blue is,
that you do not have to erase it, but may work over it
with a pen, as the blue does not photograph. Besides
transferring the outline it is also advisable to outline the
shape of any of the shadows you intend to introduce.
You then endeavor with the pen lines to imitate the
delicate shadows of the half-tone or wood cut. Perhaps
instead of saying imitate, we would better say
approximate, for you must not expect to be able to imitate
with pen the extreme delicacy of a
half-tone.

definite character of our illustrations to the last
two chapters should have made so strong an
impression upon the reader (<i>if</i> he practices drawing)
that there ought to be little necessity of further letterpress
explaining the different technics of pen
drawing. <span class="xxpn" id="p133">{133}</span>
So please permit us to introduce a large number of illustrations
in this chapter, with slight comment; it being
surmised that the reader will, however, give a fuller
consideration to the drawings themselves than we do.
Each one should be studied again and again, the reader
not copying it, but making a drawing in the same style
of some similar object. This chapter, moreover, must
serve as a general résumé of our instruction in freehand
drawing and pen drawing; it virtually ends the first part
of our text-book; the succeeding matter will be confined
to the consideration of different methods of decorating
title-pages, and of designing chapter headings,
tailpieces, etc.; and the third part will consist of the
consideration of different methods of engraving, chalk-plate,
wood engraving and color printing.</p>

<p>Now for our résumé.</p>

<p>In order to learn to draw you must first learn to
discern the outline of objects, which you may do by
seeing them in silhouette.</p>

<p>To draw the hair in outline, as in Vallotton’s third
Nietzsche, you must first see the hair as in the first
Nietzsche; that is, see it in mass or in silhouette in
nature. Before Vallotton took a brush in hand to put
on the solid black of the hair in number one you may
be sure he drew a pencil outline like the outline in
number three; but before he drew that outline he saw
the mass as in number one.</p>

<p>The Vallotton drawings may be further studied from
two very different view-points. The third Friedrich
Nietzsche is pure outline, like the examples of
Engström<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="spnillohead">HEADS DESIGNED BY F. VALLOTTON.</span>
<span class="spncpg1">
  Vallotton has made it a practice to engrave a great
  many of his own designs. We do not know whether
  these heads were engraved by him, or merely drawn
  by him and photo-engraved, but the manner in which
  they are designed—that is, with great economy of
  line, and a few simple, telling spots—is one which
  is the outgrowth of his practice in wood engraving;
  he would work exactly like this if drawing on wood.
  (We shall treat of wood engraving for printers in a
  future chapter.)</span><!--spncpg1-->

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
<span class="xxpn" id="p136">{136}</span> given in our early chapters, and is very simple and easy
to understand, though not by any means easy to draw.
The drawing of Malthus, on the other hand, is not easy
to understand, for in addition to the outlines it is modeled—that
is, it contains masses of shadow which bring
out the different planes of the face. And it is necessary
to study light and shade, as indicated in Chapter VII,
before we can fully understand a drawing of this kind.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>In order to model, you must learn <i>to see the light and
shade upon objects</i>. When your eye is trained to see
light and shade, you can draw the hair as in the second
Nietzsche, and you can see planes in the face, as in the
Malthus.</p>

<p>Although the David d’Angers diagrams were drawn
to show the general masses of the head as they are
brought out in successive stages by a sculptor, yet
they become very interesting to the printer who has not
had the benefit of an art school education, for they show
him at a glance how much of the character of the
human head is dependent upon the different planes of
the face, and it explains better than words what is meant
by planes. Chapter VIII should be read in connection
with it, and the Vallotton portraits, especially that of
Malthus, may be examined critically with this in mind,
for you will then see that Vallotton has introduced
masses of black with the idea of suggesting planes in
the face.</p>

<p>We introduce the de Chaume to accompany the
David d’Angers, Lormier and d’Illzach medallions, to
emphasize the matter of the planes of the human
face.<span class="spnpbk">

We do not want our readers to think that the shadows we have pointed
out in our text are the only ones to be noticed in the human
face. Under certain circumstances, notably when an actor’s face
is illuminated by the footlights, there are shadows upon it quite
different from those we have analyzed in previous chapters. But the
shadows we have pointed out are those most prominent in a photograph,
and those most frequently employed by the artist, but if your drawing
is to be very extensive you must learn to look for new shadows in new
aspects; and the de Chaume shows some such shadows, yet in the case of
the naso-labial line it is easy to see
that</span><span class="spnpbk">

<p>Again, much of our instruction has been given using
the human face as a basis of study; but it is not for a

be limited to the human face. We have intended only

While it is well to confine yourself to outline, or outline

may experiment in many more complicated methods, as
seen in the Monet, and the Ringel d’Illzach, for even if
you do not use these methods for illustrations they help
you to observe the capital lights and darks in

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b> R<b>EADER</b></span>
is asked to view this second part of
“Drawing for Printers” differently from the first
part. In the first part the writer aimed at
establishing <span class="xxpn" id="p154">{154}</span>
recognized rules for drawing rather than giving his individual
opinions.</p>

<p>He thinks that very little of the first part of the book
can be questioned. For example, it is not a matter
of personal opinion that the horizon line is on a level
with the spectator’s eyes, or that a mantelshelf on such
a level should be drawn with a straight line; it is a
matter of fact, which he merely reiterates as the writer
of a grammar reiterates the indisputable facts of a language,
that a noun is a name word, a verb an action
word, an adverb a word which qualifies a verb. But
when the writer of a literary text-book has exhausted
his rules of grammar and takes up the subject of rhetoric,
although he endeavors to give only such examples of
writing as are excellent, still his own personal taste is
apt to guide him in his selections, and he may claim as
admirable that which is to be criticised. A rhetoric of
the eighteenth century would necessarily contain much
artificial, sentimental and Latinized English which a
teacher of today would not put before his students.</p>

<p>So it is that in the following chapters I may advocate,</p>

<ul>
<li><p>(1) That which may not meet with the approval of
my readers.</p></li>

<li><p>(2) That which may not suit my readers’ customers,
and even</p></li>

<li><p>(3) That which is wrong.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>You therefore may use as much of my advice as you
find practical in your daily work, and discard that which
is impractical. <span class="xxpn" id="p155">{155}</span></p>

<p>But do not forget that that which may be impractical
today may come in handy some time next year!</p>

<p>That there will be much that you will find impractical
goes without saying. It is absolutely necessary that the
student of the arts (as the writer of these papers)
acquaint himself with that which is classical; he then
becomes fascinated with it and recommends it. But the
classical covers an immense field, embracing that which
is best in many ages and in many different lands, and it
is utterly impossible that the practical worker in the arts
should utilize all the classical styles at one time. Hence
only a fragment of any text-book built upon the study
of the classic can be practical at any given time.</p>

<p>Let us be more specific. Let us take the department
of lettering alone. If an author publishes a work on
lettering, and he is a cultivated man, he must examine
the many styles of the past. He examines the monumental
letter of classic Rome and the monumental letter
of the Renaissance; the Caroline letter of 700 A. D., as
well as the Gothic and the Visigothic. It is not his
business to place one above the other, but to explain the
beauty of all. If, however, you are a printer of today,
and the Morris style of type is most in vogue, and you
have stocked your cases with it, it is the Gothic letter
you are most interested in, because it is what you are
using and what your customer has just been trained to
like; so the most practical part of a book on lettering
would be that which would treat of the Gothic letter,
and its offspring, the Old English; while the chapter
on Visigothic, with its twisted letters, would seem
quite<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="xxpn" id="p158">{158}</span> impractical to you as you could not use the examples
given. Yet it would be the business of the writer on
alphabets to analyze them thoroughly, otherwise his
work would be incomplete.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Now then, I shall try to be practical, and in the
chapter on lettering bear in mind that the modern fonts
are the Morris, Caxton, Jenson, Erhard Ratdolt, Old
English and Touraine. I shall try to give a little more
attention to the letters after which these are patterned
than I shall to the Phœnician or Etruscan, the Visigothic,
the Aldine, and the Irish text letter. But, on
the other hand, no printer can be educated without
knowing something about these latter alphabets. And
so you must bear with me while I analyze them, though
they may not be practical.</p>

<p>Once more, suppose you do agree that a style of
lettering not now in vogue is a pleasing style, and one
worth imitating, the question arises, How much time can
you give to the study of it in order to use it? Nearly
all artistic work requires hand labor, and hand labor is
slow.</p>

<p>In our chapter on wood engraving, we shall recommend
the study of that art, both because it can be used
and because it trains you to appreciate good designing;
but how many printers can neglect their business in
order to spend hours and hours in practicing an eminently
slow art, when rapid and cheap photo-engraving
will serve the purpose almost as well? Very few, I fear.</p>

<p>So, also, when we come to the matter of taste, we
come to the question of what should artistic
printing <span class="xxpn" id="p159">{159}</span>
look like? Even if you are convinced that coated paper
and the half-tone do not belong to ideal printing, how
many can afford to attempt a piece of rough printing
with heavy type, coarse paper and an outline device,
and expect to retain his customers, when his rival,
Smith, is using coated paper and half-tones that almost
equal photographs? Very few printers, I fear, would
be able to pay expenses by such a course. There are
very few merchants but would have their catalogues
printed by Smith with half-tone illustrations of photographs
of their wares. Or even if the printer does not
apply his art methods to job printing, but to his own
publications, he will probably find few buyers who are
cultured enough to appreciate his rough printing, so
between the amount of time necessary for preparing
artistic productions and the poor chance they have of
receiving patronage, it is very difficult for a cultured
printer to attain his ideal.</p>

<p>The writer has followed our art periodicals for years
and knows too well that nearly all of them have failed.
If artistic periodicals advertised for years to art-loving
people have failed, how little is the chance of art
methods succeeding with the people! We must, then,
bear in mind that I may recommend methods because I
know them to be artistic without expecting them to be
accepted or put in practice.</p>

<p>The practical printer’s course must be a compromise.
He introduces an artistic principle here, another
there, without ever reaching his ideal. Sometimes it is
his own circular, sometimes a literary pamphlet,
or <span class="xxpn" id="p160">{160}</span>
sometimes a poster that allows him to experiment, while
his average printing is commercial, nothing more.</p>

<p>But, let us say in parenthesis, that while we deprecate
the lack of artistic culture that prevents our
printers from turning out artistic work, we do not for a
moment claim that that which is not artistic is poor, or
that all printing that is not rough is not artistic. The
half-tone and coated paper have their use. If, as a
matter of news or information, exactness is required,
any sensible printer will turn to the half-tone for assistance.
Even Mr. Walter Crane, in publishing his book
on “Decorative Illustration,” though he uses 303
pages of rough paper to exemplify the superiority of
the simple wood cut of the past, employs eleven sheets
of highly calendered paper to reproduce delicate facsimiles
of old manuscripts! He felt that the purpose
of these supplementary pages was to illustrate and not
to embellish the book; so he sacrificed artistic harmony
for science. So, also, a printer does well, when getting
up a catalogue of houses, horses or chickens for sale,
to insert a frontispiece of coated paper and print on the
same a half-tone which gives an adequate idea of the
house, horse or chicken to be sold. That is a scientific
piece of work. The point is, that a catalogue printed
on cheap paper with an insert of a half-tone printed on
coated paper can never be an artistic unit, can never
be exhibited as a piece of artistic printing. The
French, who are extremely artistic people, have carried
delicate printing as far as it will go, and the French
printer will get you up a catalogue with a
half-tone <span class="xxpn" id="p161">{161}</span>
frontispiece, but everything will be in harmony with it;
the paper of the body of the book is coated paper, the
type is delicate, the initial letters are equally fine, and
the printing of the entire brochure is so delicate that it
is in keeping with the frontispiece. That is the right
principle for bookmaking, that the work be harmonious.
There is no objection to fine type (so long as it is not
so fine as to tire the eyes) if it is printed properly. The
main reason for recommending such heavy type as
Morris’ is, that it is pretty sure always to print well.
When a French printer turns out a cheap newspaper
he uses large type and heavy headlines, accompanied
by illustrations that harmonize with such type and
headlines.</p>

<p>Our examples of Forain’s work (see previous chapters)
show the style of the French drawing made for
the daily newspaper in harmony with the typography
and in a suitable manner for printing on poor stock.
The clipping from the French newspaper we give with
this chapter, showing different styles of watch chains, is
an excellent example of good taste in this direction.
The type, the drawing, and the rules all harmonize.
With a chalk-plate outfit a clever printer could supply
such diagrams for his paper each week without feeling
that he was transgressing the canons of the highest
form of art.</p>

<p>From this example it will be seen that one of the
requirements for a good newspaper drawing is that it
harmonizes with the type page. You may feel then that
it is not required of you to make a finished drawing
for <span class="xxpn" id="p162">{162}</span>
a newspaper—in fact, the more finished it is the less
likely it is to be a good newspaper design.</p>

<p>Another example of good newspaper designing is
the <i>Westminster Budget</i> cover. The original covered a
folio 10 by 13 inches. The paper being a cheap stock
(yellow) and the design being bold and effective, serves
as an admirable example of what we choose to call a
poor-paper design.</p>

<p>This design will in future be again considered in connection
with wood engraving and lettering; and in the
next chapter we shall consider similar headings and
covers.</p>

a very orderly writer would have finished
his introduction in the last chapter, beginning
in this with definite instruction. But I feel so overwhelmingly
the importance of the subject treated of in
the last chapter—that is, the matter of taste—that I must
before proceeding add a few more words to the subject.
Besides, further review will strengthen the reader’s
understanding of my principle of instruction, which is
that the fitness of things, the taste which you display
in following a certain kind of design, is as much a matter
of study as is the drawing of an object.</p>

<p>For example, I used the words in the last chapter,
“printing on rough paper.” Now, of course,
that <span class="xxpn" id="p164">{164}</span>
term is indefinite, and, like our terms “magazine,”
“city newspaper” and “country newspaper” printing,
can stand only for some style of printing
agreed upon<span class="spnpbk">

Front page of the French weekly, <i>Gil Blas</i>. Originally
10 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches by 15 <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>. This shows an excellent arrangement of
type for the heading and subtitles. Also, the front page cartoon, done
in excellent style, shows the use of outline and solid blacks on the
main objects, with a little parallel lining behind the objects. The
title means, “The Week in Pall Mall,” i. e., in London. “The Grand Prix
[that is, the Spring race, the Derby] has been run; brothers, we must
depart.”</span><!--spncpg1-->
</span><!--spncaption-->

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
by the writer and reader. Therefore, if you will allow,
the term “rough printing” will stand for printing corresponding
to all that done prior to the introduction
of <span class="xxpn" id="p165">{165}</span>
coated paper, and where the type used was long primer
or larger. And I choose, as a matter of taste, to insist
upon it that all printing is bad that is not done in this
way. Now, do not set me down as a faddist. I am
not thoroughly converted to Morris’ printing, because
in his matter the words are so closely run together
that they are not read with ease, and, above all things, I
do not consider the so-called “deckle-edge, handmade
paper”—which in all probability is never handmade—such
an “artistic” cloak to cover a multitude of sins
as many printers consider it. The very fact that it is
artificial and imitative makes it as objectionable as
coated paper, which also is artificial and insincere.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>The matter can be explained in this way: We may
have no objection to a dress suit and high silk hat. We
recognize in it as legitimate a style of dress as the workingman’s
overalls; but we do not like to see a man working
in a ditch clothed in a dress suit and silk hat. With
this objection almost everyone will agree. But there
are those who, wishing to follow the dictates of society,
do not like to see a man, even if he is a lecturer or a
bridegroom, disporting himself in a dress suit and silk
hat at any hour of the day earlier than six o’clock.</p>

<p>Now, there are two distinct lines of judgment. The
first is drawn so broadly that nearly all will agree. The
second line is drawn so finely that but few may agree.
But it is a fact that in either case the question is a
matter of taste. So, then, when I claim that the title
of a newspaper should be in heavy type, and not in
such script as would be appropriate for a lady’s
visiting<span class="spnpbk">

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
<span class="xxpn" id="p167">{167}</span> card, most of you will agree with me. But when I
claim that the title should be in very heavy block type,
and not in French Old Style, I shall not have so many
followers. Of course, it is true that circumstances
alter cases, and while I think it quite necessary that a
“Daily News,” “Journal” or “Press” should have
the heaviest of type, I will acknowledge that a dainty
little weekly in 8vo, called “The Needlewoman,” or
“Embroidery Notes,” might be properly printed with
a pica italic heading.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>I think the reader now understands the object of the
second part of “Drawing for Printers,” and will see
that nearly all the illustrations in it are selected with a
view to their appropriateness for rough printing, simply
because it is therein that you need to study the subject
of designing for printing. It is self-evident that to print
a half-tone cut you need calendered or coated paper,
and that with this a little half-tone initial letter could
be used, but as we study printing on poor stock, familiarity
with the styles of the past is necessary to acquaint
you with what is best in pictorial, or rather decorative,
effect.</p>

<p>This much said, let us fall to considering some principles
of designing. Other things being equal, a broad
black line is best if there is any shadow or detail in the
drawing. But if there is no shadow the outline need
not be very heavy, but the drawing may partake of a
diagram effect, as in the watch-chain illustration from
the <i>Figaro</i>, given in a preceding chapter
(page <a href="#p165" title="go to p. 165">165</a>).
Such a thin line harmonizes with the type and does
not <span class="xxpn" id="p168">{168}</span>
attract too much attention. It is also well suited for the
unimportant elements in a heading design. But if you
wish to introduce in a heading an important element like
the American eagle, the coat-of-arms of a state, or an
emblematic design for a class paper, then a strong line
or a solid black is preferable. Strong lines and blacks
are also preferable for an initial letter that is to form
part of the decoration of a page.</p>

<p>Therefore, if we consider the front page of a paper
or catalogue consisting of a heading, an initial letter
and an illustration, we may treat each design according
to the following principles. If the illustration is to be
the main thing, the heading and initial letter
would best<span class="spnpbk">

 Heading to a novel in <i>The Pall Mall Budget</i>, an

 the effect of the illustration on the same

</span><!--spncaption-->

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
be mostly in outline, as in the <i>Figaro</i> watch chains. But
if there is no illustration, and we wish the heading and
initial letter to be decorative, a heavy outline and solid
black may be used. As an example of heavy outline
and solid black we have selected the dictionary cover
by Grasset. This is strong enough to serve as a heading
for a newspaper or periodical, but in the case of
a <span class="xxpn" id="p169">{169}</span>
chapter heading such heavy lettering might not be
desirable, and the lighter <i>Pall Mall Budget</i> design
might be preferable. So, too, as in the

the illustration is not the most important thing, heavy
blacks may be used; it is an excellent example of
the <span class="xxpn" id="p170">{170}</span>
proper heaviness of the heading contrasted with an
unimportant illustration. Here, however, the black is
around, not upon, the letter.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Perhaps one of the most enjoyable features of the
printer-designer’s work is that of designing covers for
booklets and pamphlets. If he does not have to confine
himself to a definite idea, he may choose a motive
from a thousand and one different elements. Of course,
he must be more or less logical in his choice of motive,
and not put a Pierrot upon a church fair programme,
nor a bunch of violets upon a stove manufacturer’s catalogue,
though we frequently run across such designing.
One of the enemies to good designing is the prevalent
taste for photographic half-tone covers, where the stove
manufacturer requires the reproduction of his stoves on
the cover. Now, we are utterly opposed to this; not
on the ground that the picture of a stove is not a fit
emblem for a stove manufacturer’s catalogue—for it
certainly is quite proper—but we object on the ground
that the printing of it requires coated paper, which
often is not tenacious enough for a cover; and, secondly,
on the ground that the delicacy of the half-tone, which
has no strong outlines or masses of light or dark, does
not make a picture that can be seen at a sufficient
distance to warrant its being a cover. The brevier
that you use in the body of a book is not the proper
type for its cover, and so a delicate half-tone that is
appropriate for the reading pages of your catalogue
is not appropriate for its cover. The specimens we
give in this chapter, therefore, are nearly all of
them<span class="spnpbk">

</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>The design for <i>Pan</i>, by Franz Stuck, is a particularly good example.
Possibly the shadow thrown by the head is a disturbing element in the
composition; it makes the right-hand side heavy and is not in itself
decorative.</p>

<p>The spacing also between the P and the A is greater
than between the A and the N, without, so far as we can
see, having a valid reason for so being. But the design
was for the cover of a publication of artist’s sketches,
and it was consequently more permissible for the artist
to draw with freedom than had he been designing a
more conventional cover. Stuck is one of the best letterers
in Europe; and, in his more serious moments, is
most exact in his spacing. The two most interesting
characteristics of the design are the elegance of the
letters and the boldness of the drawing of the
head; <span class="xxpn" id="p173">{173}</span>
substitute more commonplace lettering as in the “Roebuck”
heading (page <a href="#p168" title="go to p. 168">168</a>)
and such delicate drawing
as in the Grasset “Encyclopédie,” and the design would
lose force as a pamphlet cover.</p>

<p>The <i>Westminster</i> design, given on
page <a href="#p157" title="go to p. 157">157</a>, recommends
itself because of the silhouette steeple, which
could be easily engraved on wood, and also because of
the lettering, which is as good an example of “pen-hand”
as is the <i>Pan</i> of “monumental” lettering. It
also suggests effects to be got by white on black, as
does the <i>Jugend</i>.</p>

<p>The “Roebuck”
(page <a href="#p168" title="go to p. 168">168</a>) lacks the elegance of
the <i>Pan</i> and the robustness of the <i>Westminster</i>, but it
shows a good style for such newspaper lettering as has
to be made quickly; as, for example, drawn on the
chalk-plate in half an hour, when perfect spacing and
proportioning is out of the question. There are times
also when a letter is needed that is not truly elegant.
It seems sacrilegious, as it were, to design a heading
for “On the Diamond and Gridiron” with letters from
a Lucca Della Robbia monument, or the Mazarin Bible.
Therefore, some such lettering as the “Roebuck”
comes in appropriate for the light departments of a
paper.</p>

<p>Akin to the <i>Pan</i> design is the <i>Jugend</i>
(page <a href="#p169" title="go to p. 169">169</a>),
though it is not nearly so good. It would be better
with a border about it, and still better if the <i>Jugend</i>
letters were not quite so narrow, and if the background
behind the girl were more simply drawn; but the letter
is good and strong, and the figure, being in
outline, <span class="xxpn" id="p174">{174}</span>
might be printed upon the roughest paper. The whole
page is interesting also as showing recent movement
in type design in Germany. This is the result of the
William Morris movement in England. It will be
noticed that the type letters are broad and well proportioned;
they are virtually modernized

Grasset, Caspari (<i>Jugend</i>), and Stuck designs given
in Chapter II. Yet I consider the present design an
admirable one. But what are the facts in the case?
The art editor, in getting up this design, had plenty of
money at his disposal. The cover was of heavy calendered
paper, the flowers were printed in half-tone in
color, and the woman’s portrait, printed in black, was
beautifully engraved on wood, a very costly process.
This single cover may have cost as much as the entire
sixteen pages of the body of the weekly.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>The Auriol heading of this chapter is French also,
and is no less artistic than the realistic flowers on the
<i>Paris Illustré</i> cover; but on account of its simplicity it
is far superior to the <i>Paris Illustré</i> as a floral design for
ordinary printing, simply because it can be printed on
cheap stock and can be cheaply and quickly reproduced.
There ought to be no mistake, then, about my
attitude in recommending one style of designing above
another. I do so from a practical point of view.</p>

<p>A third example is found in the two Burns cuts.
Surely, when I found the half-tone among the news
columns of an English art periodical I did not object to
its realism; on the contrary, it gave me a very good
idea of what the original statue was like. But think of
the expense of having a half-tone made large enough
for a poster! Also, how vague it would appear from
across the street if the poster were in half-tone.</p>

<p>But, turning to the Hassall, see how admirably the artist has given us
the impression of Burns, how<span class="spnpbk">

<p>Hence, if the printer readers wish to make a cover design containing
a portrait and flowers, I advise them not to follow the Rivoire—not
for the reason that it is inartistic, but because it is too expensive
for ordinary printing, and for cheap printing a poor imitation is
abominable; while a design like the Caspari (<i>Jugend</i>, see
page <a href="#p169" title="go to p. 169">169</a>),
where the portrait would be an outline and the lettering broad so it
could be quickly read like the word “Jugend,” and in which the floral
form should be decoratively treated like the dandelion design in the
Grasset “Larousse,” or like the Auriol,
page <a href="#p175" title="go to p. 175">175</a>, would be just as
pleasing to the eye, would print on the cheapest kind of stock, and
would, therefore, appear to the critical as an artistic design.</p>

<p class="fsz7">This
and the following chapters devoted to lettering give much
practical information to the printer which may be enhanced in value
if, before reading them, he will proceed as follows: Let him turn to
the advertising pages of some printers’ magazine and copy, <i>as best
he can</i>, three or four lines of ornamental lettering of three or four
different fonts. After he has done this, then read this chapter and the
next, and <i>follow the suggestions therein</i>. We think he will then get
a fuller benefit from them than if he reads our suggestions first and
then proceeds to letter according to our directions.</p>

<p class="pfirst padtopc"><span class="smcap">A G<b>REAT</b></span>
deal of time is wasted by the beginner
who attempts to letter because of his impression
that he can originate new styles of letters. Now, a critic
sometimes speaks of “original lettering,” meaning that
the lettering shows individuality in treatment, and is not
the mere slavish copying of some conventional
form. <span class="xxpn" id="p182">{182}</span>
But in comparison to the other branches of art there is no
such thing as originality in lettering. Your letter must
be, broadly speaking, either Gothic (or blackletter,
thus
<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/uppr-a-blkltr.png"
 width="65" height="65" alt="blackletter A" />)
or Italian (or roman letter, thus
<em class="embold">A</em>); that is,
it must be built upon Gothic or Italian principles. The
best thing for the beginner to do is to obtain some examples
of good lettering and master two or three alphabets
of Gothic or Italian style. After he has done this, he
will see how all other alphabets he may come across in
printed books will conform to the same general principles
of the alphabets he has mastered. He will see
how certain minor changes may be made, and if, in the
end, he is anxious to be original he will, by broadening
a letter where it may be broadened, or bringing its
cross-bar down a little lower than usual, give a suggestion
of originality to his work. (The chances are,
however, that he will prefer to prove himself a good
workman, and be content to combine, place and execute
traditional letters.)</p>

<p>Strange’s “Alphabets,” published a few years ago, is
an excellent book to study, and we shall give several
alphabets from it. The old books on the subject are apt
to be too ornamental for the printer, and the example we
give from Niedling’s “Book Ornaments” is of far less
practical use than the Strange examples we shall give.
But the Bauernfeind alphabet is valuable for study. It
shows the construction of the capitals on a geometrical
basis, giving an idea of how monumental letters are made.
It is easy to see that with such a guide as this, made by
an architect, the commonest workman, with the aid of

dedication of a building or archway, though the letters
might be two or three feet high. A little study of this
alphabet will give you the ability to understand anything
written upon the subject of roman letters, so that the
following quotation from an article by Gleason White,
taken from the <i>Magazine of Art</i>, will immediately
become intelligible to you. Mr. White was writing of
Charles Ricketts and the productions of the Vale Press.
He said the Vale Press had its own type, its own paper
with its own watermark, but the printing was done by
Messrs. Ballantyne. The type designed by Mr. Ricketts
was “based on the precedents of the best Italian
alphabets.”</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<blockquote>
<p>Mr. Ricketts believes that the plan on which all letters
should be based is that of the perfect circle or the perfect
square; it matters not which geometrical form you choose,
since a certain number of letters—M, L, H, and the like—demand
a parallelogram, and others—C, G, Q, O—an ovate
or circular plan. If to draw this distinction between types
based on the oval or the circle appear a mere quibble, we must
remember that the difference between the Byzantine and the
Pointed styles, which divide architecture into two great sections,
is one of similar limit. There is all the difference in the
world, to a specialist in types, between a small “b,” “g” or
“o” that follows the circle
(<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/circle.png"
 width="55" height="60" alt="○" />),
and one that is planned upon
an oval
(<img class="iglyph-a" src="images/oval.png"
 width="45" height="60" alt="⬯" />)—I
wish to emphasize this point, because I know
that the designer regards it as vital; and I, for one, agree
entirely with his estimate of its importance. The question of
“ceriphs” and the angles of certain strokes; whether a&nbsp;W consists
of interlaced V’s, or of two connected only by the ceriph;
whether the ceriphs of a capital T are vertical,
or slant divers<span class="spnpbk">

plan of the letter is not secondary.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>In the beautiful Kelmscott type, as in the famous Foulis
fonts and other notable instances, the O is ovate, and all other
letters agree with it. In Mr. Ricketts’ “Vale” type, the
square and the circle dominate every letter. If this distinction
be passed over as unimportant, further contention is useless.
But on this point no compromise can be entertained. If it be
unimportant whether the arch is a semicircle, or planned, like
Euclid’s first problem, upon the intersection of circles, then it
matters little. But so long as architecture is separated by such
structural difference, it follows that an O based on a circle, or
an H based on a perfect square, must be entirely unrelated to
the ovate O or the oblong H. When taste is in question, one
allows the adversary equal vantage; but when geometry comes
in, axioms must be observed. Therefore, the ill-founded assertion
that Mr. Rickett’s type copies any modern font cannot be
allowed. You may dislike his symbol for the ordinary “&amp;,”
or dispute over the beauty of his ceriphs and the oblique strokes
of certain letters; but if you maintain that a circle and an oval
are practically alike, the question of these nicer points need
not be raised.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We give a reproduction of a page from the Vale
Press, and for comparison the Lucidario printed in Florence
in 1494. The similarity in the style of lettering is
evident.</p>

<p>An evening or two spent in copying the Bauernfeind
alphabet, and then making up one upon the principle
that most of the letters should be contained in a square
will lead you to understand the monumental letter, or
what you recognize as upper-case Roman. You might
then begin to collect pictures of mediæval and classical
monuments, and you would at a glance be able to
see <span class="xxpn" id="p188">{188}</span>
the principles upon which their inscriptions are constructed,
and you would see that though the letters of
certain monuments differed in proportion from others,
yet the letters themselves of all the classical monuments
would be virtually the same, and most of the Italian
mediæval inscriptions the same in character. An
Albrecht Durer alphabet given by Strange (on page
<a href="#p174" title="go to p. 174">174</a>)
is particularly interesting, being constructed in the
same manner as the Bauernfeind.</p>

<p>The Stimmer and Rogel Gothic alphabets are almost
worthless for printers’ designing, but it will not be without
profit for you to realize that they are built upon the
principle of the swell made with a quill pen, and this
will lead you to the study of what you recognize as
Gothic letters which grew out of the pen hand of the
middle ages. Whether in solid black or white, any
Gothic letter must have more or less the principles of
the Stimmer and Rogel alphabets. Space will not permit
of a full analyzation of the matter, so let us take the
letter L only. In its simplest form it consists of two
lines (or “limbs”) at right angles—one perpendicular,
the other horizontal. Both lines may be the same
length; but conventionality has ordered that if either be
the shorter, the horizontal should be. The irregularity
of the ends of the letter, as in the monumental letters,
is not a necessary characteristic of an L (which may
consist of two simple lines); but it is the most frequent
form in the monuments and is associated with our idea
of a capital letter. When made with a pen in the middle
ages it was sometimes customary to give the
two lines<span class="spnpbk">

 B. F. Voigt. The first alphabet, after Michael
 Bauernfeind, is a monumental letter based upon the
 square, the margins of the letters being obtained by
 segments of circles. With such a diagram a letter
 ten feet high could be made as easily as one an
 inch high, and by an ordinary workman. The printer
 would not advisedly map out his letter with such
 exactitude, but it would be well to copy several of
 the letters, if not the whole alphabet, that he may
 study the character of the monumental letter. The
 second alphabet is after Chr. Stimmer; the third
 after type, the dies of which were cut by Hans Rogel.

twist or curve that has not been given to them. In making
initial letters, in order to fill up the space it became
the practice to make two lines of the upright shaft, and
sometimes three lines were used. Cross-bars were also
introduced, so that in Caxton’s initial letters the L looks
like the monogram P. E. L. Almost nothing restrained
the caligrapher; and if he chose to make a dozen or
two upright shafts, each getting smaller than the other
on either side of the letter, the whole ending in some
such Celtic interlacing as the base of the Niedling plate,
he could do so. But none of this is an organic form of
the letter L; and additional curve is pure ornament.
The distinction between the superficial ornament and
the organic lines of a letter is easily understood by first
practicing the Caroline hand and then the Gothic. In
the next chapter we shall be more explicit as regards
details.

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">I<b>N</b></span>
the last chapter we said, “The distinction between
the superficial ornament and the organic lines of a
letter is easily understood by first practicing the Caroline
letter and then the Gothic.” Let us explain the benefit
of this practicing; the keynote to the matter is found in
our Caroline example. Draw the second I and you will
find that it is virtually a simple shaft with a little spreading
at the top and bottom. If you draw with a quill or
reed pen it is very easy to get this swell by a little
extra pressure as you begin to draw and as you finish;
and in almost all Caroline writing the I is made freehand
and the shape depends upon pen pressure and varies a
little each time the letter is made. It is not mapped
out beforehand. The thin curved line on top of the
first I is superfluous ornament; that line is made by a
second stroke. We find several such ornaments in the
first two lines which form the head of a chapter, just as
we find much ornamentation of the initial letter; but
we <span class="xxpn" id="p192">{192}</span>
do not find any ornamentation of the I’s in the eight
lines of text. There the I’s are all made with a single
stroke of the pen, so that the top and bottom of each
one is a trifle different from that of the others. In the
first line of text there is superfluous ornamenting of the
T’s, and of the H. Otherwise this is a true pen hand;
the I made with one stroke, the C, D, L, O, P, Q, U,
X, etc., with two strokes, the A, B, E, M, N, R, S,
with three. The reader is advised to copy this alphabet
with as large a quill pen as procurable, making the letters
from half an inch to an inch high, and then, turning
to the Grasset “Nouveau Larousse Illustré,” it
will dawn upon him that he knows exactly how the letters
there were made; and he will have little trouble in
imitating almost to perfection the three words, “En
Six Volumes.” When he tries the words, “Nouveau
Larousse Illustré,” he may have some trouble with
the A, the S and with the O, which does not show its
separate halves as in the Caroline: the horizontal line
of the L also is more difficult to make than if it were the
same width throughout. The I, R, N and V he will
find quite simple. As he familiarizes himself with the
Caroline M, D, V and I; with the H in the second line
of the text under the ornamental H; and with the P, S,
C, he will begin to realize that upper and lower case
letters were originally the same. He will also be surprised,
if he next falls to studying the Minnesinger
letters (last chapter) under a magnifying glass, to find
how like they are to the Caroline. Is not the capital I
somewhat clumsier than the first I in the Caroline top
line? Are not the c, d, h, i, o, p, s, u, v and y clumsier,
more angular drawings of the same letters
as in the<span class="spnpbk">

<span class="spncntr">(Ferrara, 1497.)</span>
<span class="spncpg1">
 A splendid example of Gothic lettering. It is to be
 remembered that this was originally designed with a
 reed or quill pen, and the ornamentations are such
 as may be easily made with that instrument. But its
 regularity is also due, in a small measure perhaps,
 to its having been engraved on white metal. In an
 entire book written in this style the letters would
 be less regular—a little more like the Minnesinger
 letters.</span><!--spncpg1-->
</span><!--spncaption-->

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
<span class="xxpn" id="p194">{194}</span> Caroline alphabet? You find the s more decidedly four
strokes, while in the Caroline it may be considered
three. You find the m slightly different: turn to our
last chapter and note the Hans Rogel m, which is upper
case, and see how it corresponds to the Minnesinger
lower-case m.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>The Caroline e you think, differs from the Minnesinger
e, but if you will look at the e in <i>erat</i>, third
line of text, you will see how decidedly the e there is a
lower-case e.</p>

<p>Now turn to the Bergomensis letters and recognize
that they have certain characteristics. One characteristic
is that the final letters and several others are ornamented
with the same kind of curved lines as in the first
Caroline I. Then that the letters are made with a pen
stroke, but that three strokes are frequently used where
one is satisfactory in the Caroline. This is plainly seen
in the letter I. And of these three strokes, one is the
shaft of the letter, which is long, the other two are the
top of the shaft, which extends a little to the left, and
the bottom which extends to the right. And these
three strokes become the basis of the letter i, of u which
is a double-i, of n which is a double-i, and of m which
is a triple-i. The o is made of the main shaft and the
right-hand base, and the left-hand top and the main
shaft. So you will then see that the Bergomensis is
nothing less than a more complicated and more regular
letter than the Minnesinger, which in turn is nothing less
than a more irregular letter than the Caroline! In order
to make the Bergomensis letter you must have your
pen cut to a comparatively blunt point the exact width
of the letter—a letterer uses such a pen almost
always. <span class="xxpn" id="p195">{195}</span>
When you study the Italic specimen (see last chapter,
“Lucidario” page), however, you find that the lower-case
letter is very much like the Minnesinger, except
that it is more simple and a trifle more rounded, but
note that it is evidently written with a comparatively
sharp-pointed quill pen. But it is not to be
overlooked<span class="spnpbk">

 virtually the Caroline, which is being revived by
 Grasset and Auriol in France today.</span><!--spncpg1-->
</span><!--spncaption-->

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
that the variety in the letters is still due to the pressure
of the pen. The Italic letter is best practiced with a
new quill; and then when it gets a little out of order it
may be cut a trifle and be used for a Gothic letter, like
the Minnesinger; and then when it spreads again it may
be cut a second time and then used for a broader Gothic
letter like the Bergomensis. <span class="xxpn" id="p196">{196}</span>
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Now, I do not claim that this chapter will be intelligible
to a mere reader—I feel sure that it will not be—but
to anyone who will put in practice all the exercises
I have suggested, I feel sure that it will be intelligible,
and that it will give him the foundation for the whole
study of lettering so that he may pick up any alphabet
and master its principles after a few days’
practice.</p>

is to be hoped that upon our advice the printer,
after reading Chapter I, attempted to copy some
font, and that, not following any special method, he
found it pretty tedious work: that he then read Chapters
II, III and IV, and found, with the help of our
information about the Latin capitals in a square, and
about the Gothic letter being dependent upon the
spreading of a quill pen, that things seemed clearer,
more intelligible. But we think that, with the help of
the present chapter, he will make still more progress. If
he, fully appreciating our reference to the quill pen, procured
one, and set to work studying the Grasset
letters <span class="xxpn" id="p198">{198}</span>
he must have made rapid progress; for it is only by
using the quill pen that the Grasset and Auriol letters
can be understood. So we say that if a printer will procure
one and practice the Caroline alphabet given in the
last chapter, next the Burgomensis, next the Minnesinger,
and then the Stimmel and Rogel alphabets, he
will find that he has a solid foundation on which to study
lettering, and a clear idea of the genius of letters. He
will begin to realize that the Caroline is the simplest, the
Burgomensis and Minnesinger the more complex, but
not very ornamental, though in them the caligrapher
had begun to assert himself, using a flourish from time
to time to ornament the letters. And he will notice
that these flourishes are such as are made naturally with
a quill or reed pen, and that upon these curves and
swellings are based not only the Gothic capitals, but
also what are known as lower-case letters.</p>

<p>It so happened that most of the southern scribes
(Italians and Spanish) confined themselves to a very
simple letter, while the northern ones took pleasure in
variety. The southern style is called the Italian, or
italic; the northern, the Gothic. There are many historical
instances, however, where northern manuscripts
are simple; and on the other hand, the letters of Visigothic
and Lombardic writers, though southern, were
more ornamental than those of their Roman and Venetian
brethren; and our Burgomensis specimen we call
Gothic, though it was originated in Italy. The true
southern ornamentation was originated under the Arabic
influence in Spain (at the time of the Saracenic conquest),
and traveled up to France, where it is found in
the elongated d, s and f in the French diplomatic
hand.</p>

<p>You, of course, know that when the art of printing
was invented the types had to be cast, and the dies were
naturally cut in the form of the letters of the manuscript
of the country in which the printing was done. Caxton
imitated the manuscript of the Low Countries and not
that of England, when he printed the first book printed
in English movable type. So, too, Gutenberg’s type
imitated the German manuscript, while that of Aldus,
tradition says, was cast after the manuscript of Petrarch,
and that form has been called Italian or italic ever since.
We give a specimen of Aldus’ “Horace”: copy with
a quill the lower case in it till you can write with ease,
and you will be able to write as Petrarch did. It is
harder to associate it with quill pen writing than to associate
the Gothic with the pen letter. Nevertheless, if
you will write for a little while with an old quill, lettering
like the Minnesinger, and then with a new quill imitate
the Aldus italic, you will soon see that the italic character
depends upon the pressure of the quill pen, just
as the Gothic does, though not to such a degree. Make
lower-case <i>a</i>, <i>d</i> and <i>s</i>, or an <i>m</i> several times, and you
will see what I mean. The other Italian form, which
printers do not call italic, is like the Lucidario, which is
less cursive than the Petrarchian form. When modernized,
the Lucidario becomes the “Jenson” and Morris
type (while the Aldus is our italic); it only needs a little
investigation to realize how easily it became the French
Old Style and English Old Style, and then our modern,
roman lower case.</p>

<p>It will not be difficult for you, if you will really
obtain the quill pen and practice as I propose, to realize
the truth of the following suggestions:</p>

<p>A printer should show an educated taste in his <span class="xxpn" id="p201">{201}</span>
designs. Few people know this, and your fight will
be continually against this ignorance, both
in yourself<span class="spnpbk">

and your customers. You will think that anything you
like is artistic and appropriate and you will be
tempted <span class="xxpn" id="p202">{202}</span>
to undertake it. Your customers will say that they
“know nothing about art” but they “know what they
like”; so they will pick out some ill-executed and inappropriate
job and insist upon your following it. But my
business is simply with that which is established as
standard, and not with what people like or dislike.
Now, historic association plays an important part in
designing for printers. The first page of the Larousse
dictionary is a superb example of historic association
introduced into a design. Here, to illustrate the letter
A we have letters from many different periods, but they
are all harmonious because of their ornament and their
execution. And they are appropriate because they are
historical. So if you are designing an announcement
of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, a prospectus of a
genealogical society, a book of early English poetry
(earlier than the tenth century) you could use the sixth
or seventh century A because that belongs to the very
best Irish-English lettering used between the sixth and
tenth centuries. The other letters that go with the
Larousse sixth century ornamented A specimen you
will find in an example from the “Book of Kells,”
given in Strange’s “Alphabets,” and perhaps in the
“Durham Book.” This identical A is probably from
“The Rule of St. Benedict.” Now, if you should
obtain an Anglo-Saxon alphabet and master its style
and apply it as we have suggested, it would be properly
associated with these historic subjects; so you, as an
educated printer, would know that you were right, and
any criticism would not deter you from using it.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>I take it for granted, however, that you use such
letters as this A only as initials, or in designing a
title <span class="xxpn" id="p203">{203}</span>
of a line or two; and that you would not let it occupy
too much of the page: for it is not only necessary that
a letter should be associated historically with a subject
and that it be well designed, but it must also be associated
with printing or bookmaking. It is true that
some introductory pages in the sixth and seventh century
Irish-English manuscripts were sometimes very
ornamental, but the reading pages were,
as a rule, quite<span class="spnpbk">

 This is a design by Eugene Grasset for the heading
 of a department in “La Revue Encyclopédique.” It
 represents French designing art at its best. It
 is free from conventionality, and yet orderly and
 well balanced. The Auriol design for “La Revue
 Encyclopédique” is bold and striking, but not as
 perfect as this.</span><!--spncpg1-->
</span><!--spncaption-->

</span><!--spnpbk--><span class="spnpg0">
simple. The good bookmaker never forgets his pages
are for reading. So, a Gothic ornamental letter that
might be appropriate in a stained glass window or on
a hand-painted testimonial might be offensive throughout
a printed book. I know of nothing more inartistic,
more nauseating to critics, than the millions of lithographed
mottoes, Christmas cards, etc., that the English
lithographic publishers have put out for the last
decade—overburdened with ornament that should be
painted and not printed. And so the whites in this
sixth century A, and the dotted outline around it,
make <span class="xxpn" id="p204">{204}</span>
it in a way less appropriate for general printing than the
solid black, twelfth century A.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>The middle A is in the style of the wood-cut Venetian
letter of the sixteenth century; and while on
general principles a gray background like this is not so
satisfactory as a black one, yet this is not a bad specimen
of designing, for the stipple could be punched into
the wood very deeply, and is so near together that if
one hole did fill up it would not be missed. However,
it, too, must not be used for general printing, but only
as rich ornament. It is well balanced, mind you, and
therefore the detail is not so worrying as would be as
much detail put in freehand, aimlessly and unbalanced.</p>

<p>If you will now turn to the cover design of the
Larousse given in the August number, you will find it
a beautiful production by Grasset, wherein we see also
some decorative elements that may be studied in conjunction
with what we have written in this and preceding
chapters about letters. For example, the use of line
with silhouette—we find a dandelion leaf reduced to
silhouette, and another laurel wreath like the one pictured
on the head of Goethe’s mother. But the lettering
of the title is the most interesting part of it. Grasset
has studied the Caroline letter, and reproduces it with
very scholarly fidelity. Only when you have studied
an example like the Caroline alphabet we give from
Strange’s book can you appreciate the workmanship
and good taste in the Grasset. A companion piece to
this is the heading by Auriol where we see a modification
of the monumental letter and the uncial as in the
d and the r. Here the initials J&nbsp;J and the initial L are
Gothic in principle, and you will not fail to see
how<span class="spnpbk">

of lettering. Our space is much too limited to make
such a survey very extensive, but what we shall give in

PHŒNICIAN — PHŒNICIAN ALPHABET A MONUMENTAL ONE AND
THE LETTERS LIKE OURS — FROM THE PHŒNICIAN COME THE
GREEK AND LATIN ALPHABETS, WHICH ARE USED THROUGHOUT
EUROPE TODAY.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">T<b>HE</b> G<b>ROWTH</b></span>
of written language is briefly recorded
as follows. Primitive man used signs and symbols,
as does the North American Indian. Noah understood
the symbol of the dove with the olive branch. Had he
wished to record the event of the flood he would probably
have drawn several waved lines to represent water,
and a mountain peak underneath, to show that the
water rose above the mountains. A second picture of a
dove with an olive branch would have indicated that the
waters had subsided. This method of writing was used
by the Assyrians and Egyptians 5000 B. C. With the
Assyrians the symbols developed into “cuneiform,” or
wedge-shaped signs, stamped on clay. With this form
we have nothing to do, as it never influenced our
writing; but with the Egyptians (as with the Chinese)
the symbols soon took a written form called hieratic
(used by the priests), which is the direct parent of our
own handwriting. In hieroglyphs on monuments in
Egypt, the sign for water was a horizontal zigzag, and
for a mountain a silhouette of hill-like form.
These <span class="xxpn" id="p208">{208}</span>
were painted, and sometimes partly incised on soft stone
or stucco, and had a pictorial character. But when the
priests had to write voluminous rituals, they used a reed
pen on papyrus, and reduced the silhouette pictures
to shorthand-like marks. The first example in the
Larousse Dictionary
(page <a href="#p201" title="go to p. 201">201</a>), represents the hieratic
shorthand of the hieroglyph of a bird. But not
only did the Egyptians use their signs as hieroglyphic
word symbols, but they also used them as phonetic
signs, so that the sign for water stood for both water
(<i>mu</i>) and the sound <i>n</i>. The Phœnicians and Hebrews
are supposed to have borrowed their alphabet from
the Egyptian hieratic writing; and in the transition the
irregular character of the markings of the reed pen
on papyrus disappeared and monumental regularity
took its place, as nearly all of the early Phœnician and
Hebrew writing was in the form of inscriptions on stone
and metal. But in this transition the letters did not
revert to the Egyptian hieroglyphic symbol, but simply
became an angular, simplified form of the hieratic, so
that the A became a V or caret-like form with a line
crossing it.</p>

<p>With the Phœnicians and Hebrews the signs were
never used for word signs, but for syllabic (or letter)
forms, so that with them N was simply a phonetic sign
(plus variable vowel accompaniments).</p>

<p>This alphabet was used by the Phœnicians, Hebrews,
Moabites and other Semitic inhabitants of Palestine. It
is supposed to have been carried by the Phœnicians to
Greece, and possibly to countries farther west, but until
investigation throws further light upon the subject it is
well to suppose that all the other countries of
Europe <span class="xxpn" id="p209">{209}</span>
received their alphabets from Greece, so that, virtually,
all the alphabets of Europe—Latin, English, German
and Russian-are simply modifications of the Greek
(see the succeeding specimens in the Larousse Dictionary
page). The Greek alphabet was modified in two
ways: first, in the monumental form it became more
regular—more right-angled—than the Phœnician; secondly,
in the manuscript it became much more irregular—cursive
in general, with angles not at right angles
(see cursive examples, third row of Larousse Dictionary
page)—so that in some third century manuscripts
there is as much irregularity as in the Egyptian. This
character, however, is more apt to be found in the late
Greek manuscripts—that is, those written during the
Christian era—than in classic Greek manuscripts
where simplicity and regularity prevail. It is particularly
interesting to the printer to realize this fact: for
when he sees a difference in European lettering—as,
for instance, the difference between Russian and German
text on the one hand, and English on the other—he
must remember that Russian and German are outgrowths
of the late Greek or ornamental lettering;
while English, Italian, Spanish and French are the
outgrowths of the simpler classical Greek forms. To
distinguish the two we have called the first (most of
which is irregular) Gothic, the second (which is generally
regular) Latin. But many an irregular manuscript
was written by other than Gothic scribes, and
there are some Latin manuscripts that are as irregular
as the Gothic.</p>

<p>No matter how a letter may vary in ornamentation
in a German, Russian, or English book, it is an
outcome <span class="xxpn" id="p210">{210}</span>
of a Greek original. In the Russian, in one or two
cases, a sign is a compound of two Greek letters, but in
English each letter has its Greek prototype. Now
anyone who stops to think will notice that monumental
letters on stone are about the same in all countries.
(The letters on Gothic brasses, however, are dissimilar
to the usual monumental letters.) For the monumental
letter is usually made by measuring, as in the first
Bauernfeind alphabet, and is cut by an ordinary workman
who follows a pattern, which should be simple.
Therefore, an A is nearly always two oblique uprights
and one horizontal crosspiece, like the sixth Larousse
example. The two uprights are not always at the same
angle, but they are nearly always oblique, though one
may be very near the perpendicular. The crosspiece is
sometimes oblique, but rarely at an angle greater than
fifteen degrees. So a monument erected in Greece 600
B. C., one in Rome 60 B. C., one in Italy in 1400 A. D.,
and one in Paris today, have virtually the same letter A
upon them as one written in Paris today, and a child who
had just learned its letters could recognize it in each.</p>

<p>It must not be expected that in a short treatise of
this kind we can cover the whole field of paleography,
but our few notes on the subject may indicate to some
readers a line of study that will repay anyone who
undertakes it. The easiest method is to examine manuscripts
of Bible text, where the subject matter is pretty
well known, and, following the different styles of writing,
acquaint oneself with the development of writing
in different centuries and in different countries. A valuable
handbook giving facsimiles of many Bible pages
is “Bible Illustrations,” published by Henry Frowde,
New York—it costs but $1.</p>

for our summary. My method of teaching in
this series has been one of suggestion, and very
often I have seemingly gone off at a tangent, to hint at
an application of some rule; in so doing perhaps the
chapters seem to lack continuity, but I think several
readings of them will show that there has been a logical
development throughout. Perhaps the following summary
will bring various parts together and fix all in the
memory.</p>

<p>First, the student is advised to practice drawing from
objects, and to learn to get something on the paper as
soon as possible, and then by further labor to develop
this something. There should be at first, lines and
markings showing <i>about</i> where the different parts of an
object should come. In the Lautrec drawing the lines
are not meant for a bicycle or the calves of a man’s
legs, but the lines represent about where the bicycle and
the man’s calves should come. Anything that can be
seen may be “placed” in this way—a tree, a house, a
cloud. After the student has learned to
“place”<span class="spnpbk">

 This is given as an example of rapid manner
 in placing a figure. In sketching a figure it is
 advisable always to draw the whole figure at once,
 and never finish the head first and then go to
 the hand. In a few lines, a correct draftsman may
 indicate a great deal. It is also given as an example
 of a reproduction from a crayon drawing. This is
 actually reproduced from a print, but the artist
 originally drew on a stone with crayon, and crayon on
 paper will reproduce by photo-engraving as well as
 this. Lithograph crayon may be used, or an ordinary
 hard crayon (the softer the better), or Hardtmuth’s
 crayon pencils. Charcoal paper may be used, or any
 of the special crayon papers. The more grain on the
 paper, the better.</span><!--spncpg1-->

<span class="xxpn" id="p213">{213}</span> objects fairly well, he finds that by going over his sketch
lines, and improving them a little, he can make outline
drawings. Outlines are frequently used for finished
effect as seen in the Beggarstaff poster.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Of course, this preliminary “placing” of the lines is
difficult until the eye is trained to see correctly.
I have<span class="spnpbk">

known beginners who could hardly grasp the idea of
what an outline is, so I suggest the excellent method of
trying to see objects as silhouettes. It is not a bad plan
to put a whisk broom, a screw-driver and a hammer
against a window pane and draw them in
silhouette. <span class="xxpn" id="p214">{214}</span>
The Beggarstaff is very interesting from this point of
view—if you will think of the cocked hat as a mass,
like the Quaker hat, you will find it easier to draw its
outline than as if you see it in all its component parts, as
in the Penlick drawing. We have given previously many
silhouette illustrations to emphasize this method of seeing
things in mass. We also make this point: that the ability
to see objects in silhouette is helpful, not only for the
purpose of representing an entire object in silhouette,
but also because details can frequently be thus represented
with excellent effect. For example, the hair and
mustache in the Penlick, and the hair in the Dailly are
in silhouette.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Besides outline and silhouette, shading may be employed
by the draftsman to bring out form. The Dailly
differs considerably from the Beggarstaff—it is fully
shaded, and shading brings out the forms
of the planes and muscles of the face.</p>

drawing. It is partly shaded. The
Sphinx design is an excellent example
of shading contrasted with silhouette.
In order to learn to shade, it is well
to draw from white objects, such as
plaster casts or pasteboard boxes,
placed in a good light, which should
come from one direction only. It makes little difference
what material is used to draw with; your aim should be
to accustom yourself to distinguish light and shade. If
you can distinguish it upon the object it is not difficult
to draw it on paper.</span></span></p>

<p>The “Théatre du Chat Noir,” designed by the same

also, you see, goes back farther than the fifteenth
century. Now, does not that suggest to you that
in modern designing there may be much recourse to
antique styles? Recognizing this, you will grasp our
idea in publishing these different Ls. We do not
say any special one, like our initial “L,” could be
of immediate use to you; but we do say that, in the
hands of a clever designer, every one could serve
as a basis on which to build a style of design.<br

and flowers are not the
only motives at the designer’s
service. Here is a little street
vista in which the suggestion of
buildings is nicely brought out,
yet the lines are by no means

been cut away in the process of
engraving, we hardly miss them;
and if a few more should be cut away from the design
as it is, they would not be missed. A style of designing
in which free lines are used in this way has its value,

<p>It is probable that all the early
Italian and French leather book-covers
were imitations of Arab book-covers
(or, at any rate, Eastern
covers) brought into Europe by the
Moors in the twelfth and thirteenth
centuries. Their Mohammedan religion
forbade their picturing the
figures of man or beast, and so the efforts of their
designers were almost entirely centered on lettering,
and on interlacing streamers or bands, or whatever we
may call them (since these were also used by Celtic and
Byzantian designers they are sometimes called Celtic or
Byzantian interlacing); and their book-covers consisted
of beautiful inlays of colored leather on ingenious combinations
of interlaced lines.<br class="brclearfix" /></p>

ENGRAVING — PHOTO-ENGRAVING THE MORE PRACTICAL,

ENGRAVING — SIMPLE SUBJECTS AND A SIMPLE TECHNIC ARE
ADVISED FOR BEGINNERS — MANY CASES INSTANCED IN WHICH
CRUDE OR WORN PLATES AND WOOD TYPE MAY BE IMPROVED BY
A LITTLE HAND WORK.</p>

<p class="pfirst"><span class="smcap">W<b>E</b> W<b>ISH</b></span>
to supplement the preceding pages with
a chapter on the technic of wood engraving, and
a few words about kindred arts which are of special consequence
to the illustrator-printer. The art of wood
engraving I consider one of the most valuable things
for the illustrator-printer to learn. True, this art is
going out of use because of its tediousness; and, it
must be confessed, if you wish a picture of a building
in your paper, it is much more economical and you can
get a better result if you make a pen drawing and send
it to be photo-engraved, than if you engrave it on wood.
On the other hand, you get, in an engraved line, whether
it is white line or facsimile black line, a richness of line
that is in perfect keeping with the printed type. The
white line made by the graver is apt to be sharper and
deeper than the white space between two photo-engraved
black lines, and it does not fill up so easily.</p>

<p>We illustrate this chapter with some valuable suggestions,
and we consider that a printer who would
learn wood engraving to such an extent that he
could <span class="xxpn" id="p224">{224}</span>
execute designs of the kind suggested, could put forth
some excellent examples of artistic printing.</p>

<p>Wood engraving is closely associated with the great
masterpieces of printing in the past, though, to be
candid, I must admit that only a limited public is capable
of appreciating these historic associations; and you
could not, perhaps, build up your job printing department
entirely on such lines. But from time to time
you might make posters, handbills and booklets, where
antique styles could be followed, and they would meet
with appreciation.</p>

<p>Nothing could be more easy to learn than the theory
of wood engraving, though the practice is trying to
one’s patience. Simply take a block of boxwood and
place it upon a leather cushion filled with sand, so that
you may turn the block of wood in any direction. The
natural tendency is to place the handle of the burin or
graver in the middle of the palm and push with all one’s
might, in order to cut away the wood; but it should be
placed against the palm, directly below the little finger,
the little finger nestling in the concave part of the
wooden handle and the other three fingers brought up
along the shaft of the graver, the ends of the fingers
touching the handle of the graver and its shaft, but <i>not
wrapped around it</i>. The instrument should be pushed
over the wood with about one-tenth of the muscular
exertion that the beginner naturally uses. Hold a well-sharpened
graver with ease and firmness, and the
process of engraving tires the arm no more than writing
does.</p>

<p>It takes three or four months’ practice to learn to
thus hold the tool and use it with such surety that
one <span class="xxpn" id="p225">{225}</span>
can draw in white line on the block as in “The Standard-Bearer”
of Schafhausen. But after the facility is
acquired, it does not take one long to get up a block
either in this style, or in what we should term the Chap-Book
style, especially when you have made your design
so simple that it can be engraved in a simple way.
Please mark this last qualification. The wood engravings
in our magazines are of a style unadvisable for the
printer to follow, for the engraving of a multitude of
gray tones and the printing of the same requires much
labor in cutting and in make-ready, but cuts of the kind
we recommend can be printed rapidly and with little
make-ready. We give a specimen of the genuine Chap-Book
illustration, and “The Pedlar’s Lamentation,”
which is a clever modern adaptation of the Chap-Book
style. These form good examples for the beginner to
follow.</p>

<p>Beyond the directions as to holding the burin or
graver, there is little that the experimenter will not find
out for himself. A design is drawn on the block with
pencil, pen or brush. When tones are to be indicated,
it is advisable for the printer to use a pen or brush. To
lighten the yellow color of the wood, the block may first
be rubbed with Chinese white or with moistened whiting.
The design may then be sketched in pencil, and afterward
drawn in ink. As the design must be in reverse,
a good way is to draw it with a pen on thin, smooth
paper. A piece of transfer paper, like typewriters’
carbon paper, is laid on the block; the design is laid
face downward upon this, and a hard pencil or stylus is
used to go over the back of the design, which can be
seen through the thin paper. The pressure
transfers <span class="xxpn" id="p226">{226}</span>
the mark of the transfer paper to the block, rendering
the design in reverse, and it may then be drawn over
with a pen or brush. In a good wood
engraving the<span class="spnpbk">

curving of lines is generally reduced to a minimum.
Though the transferring and careful cutting around the
line is wearisome at first, it allows one to consider each
line separately and thoroughly to study economy of
line. <span class="xxpn" id="p227">{227}</span>
The block is held, if small enough, between the thumb
and first finger of the left hand, the fingers holding not

It is then easily turned from side to side on the leather
pad. When a curved line is to be engraved it is not
the graver alone which moves, but the block also is
directed with the left hand, so as to assist
matters. <span class="xxpn" id="p228">{228}</span>
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>The first process in engraving a line is to take a fine
tool (called a tint-tool as distinguished from the blunter
tool called a graver) and outline the line. In the Schafhausen
cut, the white line around the man’s legs gives a
good idea of the proper character of such an outlining
line, except that the line should be thinner, more uniform,
and more like the lower part of the outline of the
sword and the outline of the left side of the staff of the
standard. The wood is cut away from both sides of a
black line; and then with a gouge of any convenient size
the wood is further cleared away. In this way the genuine
Chap-Book cut was produced. The white line of
the “Standard-Bearer” of Schafhausen can easily be
combined with tint lines. Tint lines may be seen in the
Chap-Book imitation. It is advisable to draw simple
or rough subjects at first; and to draw your outlines
heavier at first than you intend them finally to be, since
in cutting away you are apt to reduce them by a slip of
the tool or by a little more pressure in one place than in
another, and then it is necessary to go around the line
again to reduce it to uniform regularity. It is better to
draw a face like the one in the Crawhall than like the
genuine Chap-Book example, for in following the lines
of the latter a slip of the burin might entirely destroy
an eyebrow or the bridge of the nose; but in the Crawhall
any of the lines might be reduced to a somewhat
narrower one without interfering with the general effect.
The beginner is advised to confine himself to initial letters
and tailpieces and not to attempt ambitious subjects.
He is also especially advised not to plan out, on the day
he receives his tools, a cut for a job wanted immediately,
for he will surely have to keep that order waiting a
week<span class="spnpbk">

pieces from one inch to three inches long and one to
two inches wide, if not squared off, may be obtained for
about 25 cents from a boxwood supply house. The
printer may square these scraps with a miter box and
saw, and he can proportion his designs to the size of the
scraps. Thus, illustrations and devices may be got up
for a mere song. Larger blocks of boxwood may be
ordered at 3 or 4 cents a square inch, which is nearly
the cost of photo-engraving; and as it takes longer to
engrave than to draw in pen-and-ink, wood engraving
is not recommended for general illustration. But as
photo-engravers usually have a minimum price of from
75 cents to $1 for each cut, it is cheaper to cut initial
letters and tailpieces on scraps than to have them photo-engraved.
For instance, twenty photo-engraved tailpieces
might cost you from $15 to $20, but they might
not cost you $2 if boxwood scraps were used.
</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>In previous illustrations, such as the head of Göthe’s
mother, the Grasset typographical ornaments, the Vallotton,
Auriol and Hassall examples, we gave suggestions
for exercises in wood engraving. The benefit derived
from the practice of wood engraving is not limited to
preparing new cuts alone. No printer who uses illustrations
should be without a wood engraving outfit, consisting
of four to six tools, and the cunning to use it.
There are many cases in which a process plate, or a
chalk plate, or old wood type, can be cleaned up, altered
or improved with a little handwork. Sometimes in a
zinc plate the fine lines in a sky print clearly on a small
run, but soon begin to round and flatten; if not essential
to the design they may then be entirely cut
out <span class="xxpn" id="p231">{231}</span>
and the run continued. In chalk plate, surfaces may
be cast black and then cut into with a white line, as
in the Schafhausen. And wood type which is too old
to print a solid black evenly, may be punched with
an awl, as in the background of the Larousse Dictionary
A, to reduce it to a stipple gray; or white-lined
like the following portrait; or the sides may be trimmed
with the graver. Rouletting can be imitated with a<span class="spnpbk">

common graver by cutting across the line at regular
intervals. Only when a <i>series</i> of lines has to
be rou­let­ted is it nec­es­sary to have a special
ins­tru­ment, which costs from $1.50 to $3. New
pro­ces­ses are being de­ve­l­oped every day where­by

<p>In order to train one­self to en­grave a tint as in the

par­al­lel <span class="xxpn" id="p232">{232}</span>
lines on a block with­out any draw­ing on it. Ta­king a
tint tool, you en­grave a line on the wood, of any thick­ness,
and then be­low it en­grave another line, leav­ing
be­tween the two a ridge of wood the same thick­ness as
your white lines. It is then your task to
cover your<span class="spnpbk">

<p><span class="smcap">Z<b>INC</b></span>
<span class="smcap">P<b>LATES</b>.</span>—Experiments may be made in zinc
plates. The cut above was traced from the Grasset cut
given with Chapter III, Part I. Between the
tracing <span class="xxpn" id="p235">{235}</span>
paper and the zinc, typewriting carbon paper was laid.
The tracing was gone over with a hard pencil; the
design was thus transferred to the zinc. The lines
were then covered with asphaltum (which is the same
as bitumen), bought in a tube at a paint store. Any
colored oil paint or varnish or transfer ink will do, as
its use is simply to hold the dragon’s blood. It may
be thinned with turpentine so that it will flow easily
from the brush. While the asphaltum was still wet,
the plate was dusted with dragon’s blood, which was
put in a coarse linen rag and held like a bag over the
plate by the right hand; the left hand tapping the right
made the powder fall evenly over the plate. Do this
carefully for practice in order to learn to powder a plate
evenly for a stipple tint (see farther on); the dragon’s
blood may be dumped on the plate. The plate was
then dusted off with a camel’s-hair brush, which
removed the dragon’s blood from the plate except
where bitumen held it. The plate was then held over a
flame till the dragon’s blood turned black; it was then
immersed in an acid bath, about ninety per cent water
and ten per cent nitric acid. The vessel (an old baking
pan painted with asphaltum) holding the bath was
rocked from time to time. The dragon’s blood served
as a stopping-out varnish. The acid will eat away the
plate where it is not protected by dragon’s blood. After
five or ten minutes, when the acid seemed to be eating
into the stopping-out varnish, the plate was taken out,
washed and dried, and again dusted with dragon’s
blood. (In using a large plate, of course, it would be
easier to roll it up with lithographic transfer ink.) A
second and third etching reduced the background,
so <span class="xxpn" id="p236">{236}</span>
that a proof was taken. For printing in this book the
plate has been routed. The ragged edge is due to our
’prentice hand; this is our second experiment, but a
little practice, we are certain, would bring more satisfactory
results. The Pan lettering is copied from the title-page
by Stuck, given in Chapter II, Part II,

<p>Designs for this process should not be drawn in fine
lines like Engström’s portrait of himself, but should
be heavy like his portrait of “Hedin” and the Molock
“Crispi.” (See Chapters I and II, Part I.) When a
white background is not required, the dragon’s blood
dusted on the plate may be allowed to remain upon it,
in which case a stipple background is the result. An
ingenious experimenter can get many different results by
this stipple method.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">C<b>OPPERPLATE</b></span>
<span class="smcap">E<b>NGRAVING</b>.</span>—Copperplate engraving,
and etching in intaglio are not used by the typographical
printer, but the printer who executes very fine
work would find that he could make handsome frontispieces
for limited editions, or book-plates, by
either <span class="xxpn" id="p237">{237}</span>
of these processes. For about 25 cents one may obtain
Winsor &amp; Newton’s handbook on “The Art of Etching,”
by H. R. Robertson, which will give a description
of the first process.</p>

<p>Copperplate engraving is most difficult to master
and should not be attempted by anyone
who cannot<span class="spnpbk">

draw a sure line. A designer with a sure hand might
attempt a simple book-plate. Anyone who can use the
burin on wood can use it on copper, though in the
latter case the pressure from the palm of the hand,
which the beginner in wood engraving should
avoid, <span class="xxpn" id="p238">{238}</span>
is used because the resistance of copper is much greater
than that of wood. The first finger may be placed <i>on
top</i> of the burin when engraving in copper, but at the
side for wood cutting. We would say that the engraved
line of the copperplate is one of the handsomest lines
in the graphic arts.</span><!--spnpg0--></p>

<p>Etching in intaglio is easier than copper engraving
and can be mastered by anyone who can etch in relief.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">L<b>ITHOGRAPHING</b>.</span>—Lithography, like copperplate,
requires a special press, but a secondhand press can be
bought for $25 or $30, and it is certainly the cheapest
process known for short runs of pictorial color work;
and any printer who has many orders for posters or
picture printing would do well to investigate the process;
for it is not difficult to draw on the stone, and, after the
stones are bought, they last for years, and every new
design simply necessitates the scouring off of the previous
design, which will take a boy only about an hour.
A hand press will easily print a 16 by 24 poster, and if it
is to be printed in three or four colors by relief printing,
the cost of zinc relief plates or wood blocks would be
considerable, while in the case of the lithograph it is
merely the hire of the boy who cleans the stone. There
is no end to the variety of effects to be got in lithography
by different combinations of technic: by using,
separately or in combination, pen, crayon or brush line;
crayon or spatter work tints; solid brush tints of color,
or solid brush tints of color with letters or forms

<span class="smcap">P<b>LATE</b>.</span>—The chalk-plate process is one that
has never been adequately studied by designers. There
are very many possibilities in it. It was first
introduced <span class="xxpn" id="p239">{239}</span>
into Japan through the instrumentality of the writer.
The editor of the “Kohumin Shimbun” called at my
studio to investigate the working of the chalk plate, and
I drew an outline portrait on the chalk plate, cast it,
mounted it, and took a proof of it, all in forty minutes!
Full information in regard to the process may be
obtained from the Hoke Engraving Company, owners
of the patents. Every newspaper owning a stereotype
outfit will find that it will pay to use the chalk-plate
process.</p>

The Inland Printer.

What it is.

The Inland Printer is a monthly magazine of
from 100 to 120 pages, 9 by 12 inches in size, devoted to
printing, publishing, engraving, electrotyping, stereotyping,
bookbinding, papermaking and all the kindred
trades. It is a work of art, and should be in the hands
of every lover of the typographic art or anyone interested
in newspaper work or advertising. Issued
promptly on the first of every month. Subscriptions
can begin with any number.

What it Contains.

Its pages are filled with the most instructive and
interesting original articles relating to the matters that
properly come within its domain, besides an amount of
valuable data, trade topics, correspondence, craft items,
recent patents, recipes, hints and suggestions that will
surprise you. In addition to this, it is copiously illustrated,
and the whole make-up and general character of
the work is such as to challenge admiration.

The Illustrations. The full Page illustrations and
those worked in with the text are
all of a high order, and include half-tone, zinc etching
and other methods of engraving, alike valuable to the
engraver, process-worker, compositor and pressman.
Colored plates, by various processes, are also shown.

The Text. Taking up a copy at random one finds
articles on proofreading, the point system in type
founding, notes on bookbinding, natural colors in
the printing press, newspapers and newspaper men,
the country newspaper, typographical make-ready,
advertising, convention notes, review of type designs,
pressroom queries and answers, process engraving, new
patents, trade notes and much general information.

The Advertisements. These are as important in a way as
any other part of THE INLAND PRINTER, for the reason
that they are set in attractive and catchy style,
alike beneficial to the compositor and “ad.” writer,
and printed in the same excellent way that the other
part of the journal is. This part will interest you as
well as the text.

TRANSCRIBER’S NOTE
<ul>
<li class="litn">Original spelling and grammar have generally been retained, with some
exceptions noted below. Original printed page numbers are shown like
this: {52}.
Original page images are available from

The transcriber produced the cover image by editing
the original cover image, and hereby assigns it to the public domain.</li>

<li class="litn">Illustrations are the main subject of this book. Many of the
illustrations were printed full page, and fell on numbered pages,
inside paragraphs of text, frequently breaking sentences. The List of
Illustrations and many of the cross-references point to page numbers.
Therefore, the illustrations have been left where they originally
lay—<i>i.e.</i> many of them inside paragraphs and sentences. This is
unconventional, relative to normal Distributed Proofreaders
practices.
Unlike a printed book, the last line in a broken paragraph above
the break will not be justified, except by chance.</li>

<li class="lihanga">Page <a href="#p014" title="go to p. 14">14</a>.
The name “Loewe-Marchand” was changed, in the list of

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

copied or distributed:

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the

to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
